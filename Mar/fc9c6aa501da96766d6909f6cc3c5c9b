A man described as “at the head of” a criminal organisation smuggling cocaine and cannabis into the UK hidden inside items of machinery has been jailed for 21 years. The National Crime Agency estimates that the group imported drugs with a street value of more than £30 million (€36 million) into the UK. Judge Martyn Levett, sentencing at Ipswich Crown Court, said the operation was of a “commercial scale” and that he had “no doubt that the successful importations would have continued” were it not for the authorities intercepting a shipment at Dover in 2017. Thomas Kavanagh (54) of Tamworth, Staffordshire, Gary Vickery (39) of Solihull, and 43-year-old Daniel Canning, who also has an address in Solihull, all admitted at an earlier hearing to conspiring to import class A and B drugs, and money laundering. Kavanagh, who prosecutors described as “at the head of the organisation”, was jailed for 21 years. Vickery, who was “immediately beneath” Kavanagh, was jailed for 20 years. Canning, who was “subordinate to Vickery”, and also admitted possessing a firearm and ammunition, was jailed for 19 years and six months. More to follow. - PA
