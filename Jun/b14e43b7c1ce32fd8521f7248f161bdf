Sir, – I refer to Martyn Turner’s cartoon, (Opinion & Analysis, June 8th) which reflects on the recent confidence vote in Boris Johnson. Turner’s depiction of the pain administered by the 148 Tory rebels will have caused most male readers to grimace very very tightly, even if only momentarily. On mature reflection this cartoon was thoroughly enjoyable. I am already looking forward with glee to how your cartoonist represents the delivery of two further hammer blows to the beleaguered PM after the voters of Wakefield and Tiverton get their chance on The Anti-Boris Strengthometer. – Yours, etc, PJ MCDERMOTT, Westport, Co Mayo.
