Three-times Grand Slam winner Andy Murray has ruled out any possibility of playing in Saudi Arabia in the future, adding that he had previously turned down an offer to play in the kingdom. British media reports last week said Saudi Arabia had expressed an interest in hosting a tennis tournament on the WTA Tour. Professional golf has become caught up in controversy in recent months over the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series, which has been feuding with the PGA Tour and drawn criticism from several professional golfers, mainly over the many human rights concerns in Saudi Arabia.

I wouldn’t go and play there.” The grass court Grand Slam begins on Monday, with Murray facing Australia’s James Duckworth in the first round.
