Sir, – Article 16.2.2 of the Constitution states that Dáil Éireann should have one member per 20,000 to 30,000 people, and currently we have 160 TDs. With the nation’s population now increased to 5.1 million, this requires adding at least another 11 TDs to bring us to 171, the highest number ever. But this would only bring us just inside the upper 30,000 limit. As our population increases after the next census, in four years we would need to reach 180 or more TDs. If our population keeps growing at current rates, we may need 200 TDs in 15 to 20 years. If unification were to ever happen in the next 20 years, we could need 250 TDs at least. So, instead of a population-based formula, why not fix the number of TDs to a set number? If more powers and responsibilities were devolved to local government, perhaps we could survive with a leaner Dáil Éireann of, say, 150 TDs? If that number seems low, consider that when our Constitution was approved in 1937, Dáil Éireann only had 138 TDs. – Yours, etc, JASON FITZHARRIS, Swords, Co Dublin.
