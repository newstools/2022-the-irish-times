Sir, – In light of the news that the back-to-school allowance is set to increase by €100 (News, July 5th), when are we going to have a serious debate around the costly, crested school uniforms that so many pupils are forced to wear over generic versions? I’ve heard many of the purposed justifications – that it creates a sense of belonging for pupils, that it’s a mark of respect towards the school. However, the reality is that these uniforms create a huge financial burden for parents. “Iron on” or “sew-on” crests don’t work either as the jumper is often flagged as being the wrong shade and material. Education is the one thing that can lift someone out of poverty; it’s proven to raise the rate of return to the economy. There should be no barriers, especially ones which can be so easily avoided by allowing a child to wearing a plain, cheaper, perfectly respectable uniform instead. – Yours, etc, FIONA DALY, Clontarf, Dublin 3.
