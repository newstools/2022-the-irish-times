A full house of 7,500 and live television for a spicy derby that Bohemians really need to win to maintain their relevance in the title shake-up. If only Bohs had Andy Lyons to cut inside and repeat the wonder goal that knocked Rovers out of the 2021 FAI Cup. Alas, Lyons like Danny Mandroiu has become a Hoop, so hope turns to Promise Omochere continuing his impressive rise despite the champion’s guaranteed reaction to last Friday’s defeat in Dundalk. Storming up the table, Stephen O’Donnell’s settled side will lean into the form of Robbie Benson and Scottish winger Steven Bradley to cut the five-point gap behind league leaders Shamrock Rovers, especially with the champions soon to be distracted by European football. The students’ increasingly unlikely chances of avoiding relegation depend upon the availability of Ireland Under-21 winger Liam Kerrigan and striker Colm Whelan, who suffered a cruciate ligament tear in May, so Derry should end a miserable seven-game winless streak that is threatening to derail their campaign. More goals from Eoin Doyle are needed, as the former Bolton Wanderers centre forward has finally found his groove, for St Pat’s to remain in the title conversation. Already 11 points adrift of Rovers, they cannot afford any more stumbles against relegation favourites. Sligo remain in relatively good health since parting ways with manager Liam Buckley, bagging seven from a possible nine points to lie fifth in the table, while Drogheda’s five wins from 19 matches keep them clear of the relegation zone. At this stage, both clubs would probably settle for their current position come season’s end.
