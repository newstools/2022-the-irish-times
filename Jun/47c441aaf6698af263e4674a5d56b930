Gardaí in Leitrim are investigating after a Ukrainian man in his 50s collapsed and died in the town square in the early hours of Sunday morning. The scene in Drumshanbo has been preserved as the Garda investigation continues. A postmortem examination was due to take place on Sunday. In a statement, the Garda Press Office said the man was pronounced dead shortly after he collapsed. “A postmortem is expected to take place later today which will determine the course of any investigation. The scene remains preserved at this time and enquiries are ongoing.” Fine Gael councillor Enda McGloin said he understood the man had suffered a heart attack. “It happened on the corner of what they call ‘The Square’ on Main Street. There is a pub there at the side where an incident took place.” The road in the town where the man collapsed remains closed for further examination and the investigations are ongoing. Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny has previously spoken in the Dáil about how helpful the people of Leitrim had been in terms of finding homes for Ukrainians who arrive in Ireland. More than 200 Ukrainian refugees are staying in the Lough Allen Hotel in Drumshanbo, having fled the war in their home country. Ukrainians have also settled in Ballinamore, Drumcong and Manorhamilton.
