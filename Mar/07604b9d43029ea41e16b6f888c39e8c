Cambridge Avenue is one of Ringsend’s secret streets. Dublin’s old river wall is just across from Pigeon House Road, almost at the end of this red-brick terraced cul-de-sac, and neighbours all come out on to the street to cheer and welcome cruise ships when they sail into the port, say the owners of number 7. They also hear the ships’ horns ringing in the new year every December 31st. Number 7 is on the left as you walk or drive up. Its owners bought it in 2017 and paid €426,000 for it, according to the Property Price Register. They completely modernised it, starting with a new composite front door, replaced the windows and opened up the ground floor extending out the back to give a smartly zoned space that opens into the sitting area. This leads through to the dining area with the kitchen, stained a deep diesel green by Farrow & Ball called Studio Green, to its rear. Now extending to 93sq m (1,000sq ft) it boasts a toasty B3 Ber rating. To the back of the kitchen is a play area that has been designed so that it could be turned into a third bedroom with the utility and guest bathroom hidden behind a door becoming its en suite bathroom. It’s good use of space for any potential investor for that would make it a three-bedroom house. From here the property opens out to a small, southeast-facing yard of almost 12sq m. Upstairs on the return is a bright bathroom, big for this style of house, where there is a free-standing bath and separate shower. From the tub you get views across the roofs and maybe a sliver of the Liffey on a clear day. There are two double bedrooms on the first floor. The main bedroom to the front spans the width of the property. Recent sales on the street include two in 2019: number 19, a 92sq m house in excellent condition sold for €484,570; and number 5, which measured 73sq m, sold for €415,000. Number 7 is seeking €515,000 through SherryFitzGerald.
