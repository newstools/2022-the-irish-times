The new Electoral Commission is set to have powers to crack down on misinformation being spread online during elections. The commission will be able to issue take-down and correction notices or an access-blocking notice as part of its monitoring and investigatory functions. It will also be able to issue a notice requiring any operator or host of any online platform to publish a statement informing all affected users of “manipulative” or “inauthentic behaviour” or the use of an undisclosed bot. The powers are included in amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. The Irish Times understands that under the proposals, the new commission would be the body that decides what would be considered to be “misinformation” or “inauthentic behaviour”. The Electoral Reform Bill, which is currently working its way through the Oireachtas, provides for the establishment of the new commission. Other measures are aimed at ensuring transparency in political advertising and bringing online advertising into line with existing regulations. Registering to vote is also to become more accessible and streamlined under the plans. Minister for Housing and Local Government Darragh O’Brien told the Dáil that the Bill represents a “significant reform” of Ireland’s electoral legislation, processes and structures.
