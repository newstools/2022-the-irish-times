Sir, – If we are voting by smartphone, it should only be a small step to get our phones to do the actual voting as well (Letters, July 6th). After all, they’re smart. I tried asking: “Siri, who should I vote for?” It replied, a little sententiously, with a trite: “Vote for those you believe are best. And most importantly, vote.” So much for technological progress. – Yours, etc, COLIN WALSH, Templeogue, Dublin 6W. Sir, – I take great delight at each election count seeing those pompous politicians who are seeking re-election squirm as they witness, on the eighth or ninth count, their slender lead over their rivals being inexorably whittled away, leaving them defeated and totally deflated. We, the electorate, should not be denied this small pleasure we earn and richly deserve, in return for enduring their years of hubris. Voting by smartphone would rob us of this little comfort. – Yours, etc, BOBBY CARTY, Templeogue, Dublin 6W.
