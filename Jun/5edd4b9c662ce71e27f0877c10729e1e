Stephen Kenny drafted Cyrus Christie and Jason Knight into his Republic of Ireland team as they look to end their wait for a first Nations League victory against Ukraine at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 7.45pm). Full back Christie replaced injured captain Séamus Coleman, while Derby midfielder Knight got the nod ahead of striker Troy Parrott in the only two changes to the side which lost 1-0 in Armenia on Saturday. Ukraine boss Oleksandr Petrakov retained only one of the men who started Sunday’s 1-0 World Cup playoff final defeat in Wales with Everton’s Vitaliy Mykolenko starting once again in an XI captained by Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk, winning his 50th cap. REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Kelleher, Christie, Collins, Duffy, Egan, Stevens; Hendrick, Cullen; Robinson, Ogbene, Knight. UKRAINE: Lunin; Kacharaba, popov, Bondar, Syrota, Mykolenko; Shaparenko, Sydorchuk; Zubkov, Dovbyk, Murdryk.
