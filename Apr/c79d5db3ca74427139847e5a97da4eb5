A Red Cross convoy will try again to evacuate civilians from the besieged port of Mariupol on Saturday as Russian forces looked to be regrouping for new attacks in southeast Ukraine. Encircled since the early days of Russia’s five-week-old invasion, Mariupol has been Moscow’s main target in Ukraine’s southeastern region of Donbas. Tens of thousands there are trapped with scant access to food and water. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sent a team on Friday to lead a convoy of about 54 Ukrainian buses and other private vehicles out of the city, but they turned back, saying conditions made it impossible to proceed. “They will try again on Saturday to facilitate the safe passage of civilians,” the ICRC said in a statement. A previous Red Cross evacuation attempt in early March failed. Russia and Ukraine have agreed to humanitarian corridors during the war that have facilitated the evacuation of thousands of civilians. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from Ukraine’s besieged regions have been planned for Saturday. The planned corridors include one for people evacuating by private transport from Mariupol and by buses for Mariupol residents out of the city of Berdyansk, Ms Vereshchuk said. The ICRC said its Mariupol operation was approved by both sides, but key logistics were still being worked out. In an early morning video address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that Russian troops had moved toward Donbas and the heavily bombarded northeastern city of Kharkiv. “I hope there may still be solutions for the situation in Mariupol,” Mr Zelenskiy said. “The whole world has to react to this humanitarian catastrophe.” Ukrainian forces retook areas around Kyiv on Friday as Moscow accused its neighbour of jeopardising peace talks by conducting a helicopter attack on a fuel depot across the Russian border. At peace talks this week, Russia said its war efforts would now focus on Donbas, where it has backed separatists fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Russian troops left behind shattered villages and their own abandoned tanks as they moved away from the capital Kyiv. After failing to capture a single major city, Russia has painted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in the peace negotiations. Ukraine and its allies say Russian forces have been forced to regroup after suffering heavy losses. British military intelligence said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces continued to advance against withdrawing enemy forces in the vicinity of Kyiv, and that Russian troops had abandoned Hostomel airport in a northwest suburb of the capital, where there has been fighting since the first day. The British daily assessment said Ukrainian forces had secured a key route in eastern Kharkiv after heavy fighting. Odesa targeted In the early hours on Saturday, Russian missiles hit two cities, Poltava and Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, Dmitry Lunin, head of the Poltava region, wrote in an online post. He said infrastructure and residential buildings were hit, but he had no casualty estimates. Earlier, as sirens sounded across Ukraine before dawn on Saturday, the Ukrainian military reported Russian air strikes on the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne in Luhansk. In that eastern region and neighbouring Donetsk, pro-Russian separatists declared breakaway republics that Moscow recognised just before its invasion. The Ukrainian military also said defenders repulsed multiple attacks in Luhansk and Donetsk on Friday and that Russian units in Luhansk had lost 800 troops in the past week alone. These claims were unable to be verified. Three Russian missiles fired from Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, struck a residential district of the Black Sea port of Odesa, causing casualties, Odesa’s governor, Maksym Marchenko, said on Friday. But officials in Odesa said anti-air defences thwarted an attack on critical infrastructure. The account could not be immediately verified. United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths will travel to Moscow on Sunday and then to Kyiv as the UN pursues a humanitarian ceasefire, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres told reporters. Aiming to lower nuclear tensions with Russia, the US military cancelled an intercontinental ballistic missile test that it had initially aimed only to delay, the Air Force told Reuters. But the US and its European allies have sent Ukraine military assistance. Late on Friday, the Pentagon announced an additional $300 million worth which included laser-guided rocket and anti-drone systems. Washington will also work with allies to transfer Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine to bolster its defences in Donbas, the New York Times said, citing a US official. The Pentagon declined to comment, while the White House did not immediately respond. – Reuters
