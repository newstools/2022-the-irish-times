Sir, – What a pity that Irish media coverage of Irish competitors in international motorsport only finds the death of a competitor worthy of mention (“Northern Irish rider Morgan dies in third fatal crash”). This sensational journalism is evident on our TV stations as well as our print media. Irish competitors have enjoyed huge success all over the world with virtually no support from our press And before anyone jumps on the health and safety bandwagon, every single person who competes in any form of motorsport is well aware of the danger involved before they start their first lap. – Yours, etc, ALEX TAYLOR, Ballinteer, Dublin 16.
