Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. The Brazil forward has joined for £45m and is Mikel Arteta’s fourth purchase of the summer. Jesus, who scored 95 goals in 236 games for City across five and a half seasons, follows the midfielder Fábio Vieira, goalkeeper Matt Turner and another Brazilian forward, Marquinhos, into the club. The 19-year-old Marquinhos has been described by Edu, Arsenal’s technical director, as one for the future. Jesus has joined Arsenal in pursuit of more regular game time after starting 24 of City’s 50 Premier League and Champions League matches last season. Arsenal said the 25-year-old would wear the number nine shirt and had signed a long-term contract. Arteta, who worked with Jesus while assisting Pep Guardiola at City, told Arsenal’s website: “I’m very excited. The club has done a tremendous job to recruit a player of this stature. I know Gabriel personally very well, and we all know him well from his time in the Premier League and being really successful here. “This is a position that’s been on our radar for a long time now and we have managed to get a player that we all wanted, so I’m really happy.” Jesus said he had followed Arsenal when he was young because of Thierry Henry and that Arteta’s presence had played a part in his transfer. “I believe 100 per cent in Mikel,” he said. “I had a very good time with him before, he’s a very good guy and a very good coach as well. He helped me a lot.” City are expected to announce the signing of the midfielder Kalvin Phillips from Leeds for £42m plus add-ons on Monday.
