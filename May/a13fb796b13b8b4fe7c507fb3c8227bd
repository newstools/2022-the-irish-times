Stephen Bradley will be staying with League of Ireland champions Shamrock Rovers amid interest from League One side Lincoln City. Shamrock Rovers released a statement on Friday confirming that, “despite interest from abroad to sign our head coach, Stephen Bradley remains committed to Shamrock Rovers. “The club and Stephen share the same view that there is more to be achieved, domestically and in Europe, with the excellent squad and staff that has been assembled.” Bradley took over the first team in July 2016 and won the FAI Cup in 2019 and the league in 2020 and 2021. Ahead of tonight’s clash with Finn Harps, Bradley himself added: “During the past few days there has been much speculation about my immediate future as Shamrock Rovers head coach. “I would like to thank Lincoln City for expressing an interest in speaking to me about their vacant managerial position. Like every manager and coach I one day have an ambition to test myself in different countries and at different levels of the game. “But right now, I am very happy to stay and continue my work at Shamrock Rovers. I love this club and I feel that our work here is not yet complete. The exceptional squad of players that we’ve built and our incredible fans makes me feel so hungry that we have a real opportunity to achieve more success at home and in Europe to match the ambitious targets the we have set ourselves as a club over the next few years. “I would like to thank the chairman and the board for their counsel and support over the past few days. We have a huge few months coming up starting with tonight at home against Finn Harps and me, my staff and the players are ready to go.”
