Pop star Harry Styles has been spotted out and about in Dublin ahead of his sold out Aviva Stadium gig on Wednesday night. The former One Direction star was snapped by eagle-eyed fans in Dublin city centre on Monday night. The British singer was accompanied by his actor and director girlfriend Olivia Wilde, with the pair searching for a place to eat on South William Street. He and Wilde have been together since January. Wilde directed Styles on the film set of Don’t Worry, Darling, which also stars Florence Pugh. Styles was also spotted at the Vico Baths in Dalkey on Tuesday, where he was greeted by fans. Styles was seen sporting a bright yellow Tower Records bag, prompting the Dublin music shop to tweet: “What’s in @Harry_Styles’s Bag?” This is not the first time an A-lister enjoyed the South Dublin swimming spot. Actor Matt Damon was also seen enjoying the Vico Baths during his time in Ireland during the first Covid-19 lockdown, when images of the Good Will Hunting star holding a SuperValu reusable bag went viral online. Styles is in Dublin as part of his Love On Tour tour, and his third album, Harry’s House was released in May. Arlo Parks, the supporting act, will take to the Aviva stage at roughly 7.15pm, while Styles is due to come on at 8.45pm. All trains and buses to Dublin from Cork and Limerick are sold out because of the concert. Fans are advised to take public transport: The Aviva Stadium is next to the Lansdowne Road Dart station, and the 4, 7 and 18 bus services also run close to the venue. Ticketmaster also reminded fans that no one under 16 will be allowed on the pitch for standing, and that under 16s must be seated and accompanied by a parent or guardian. No bags are allowed inside the stadium, except small handbags, which can be searched.
