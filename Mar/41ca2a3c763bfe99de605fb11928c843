Town Address: 10 Kinahan Street, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald. This quaint two-bedroom cottage, though not large at 41sq m (441sq ft) makes the very most of its space. With walnut flooring, a white palette means the property – which has a south-facing courtyard – is bright and airy. Located close to the Phoenix Park, this house has a newly installed gas boiler with climate control. Plus: Charming property in a great location. Minus: BER of E2 is rather low. Country Address: The Old Post Office, Church Cross, Skibbereen, west Cork. Agent: Pat Maguire Properties. Hidden behind a mature cypress tree, this lovely old post office, situated three miles from the town of Skibbereen is full of charm. With three bedrooms, the house lies on a 0.3 acre site of mature landscaped gardens. Some of the pine interiors would benefit from a lick of white paint to brighten and modernise the space. Plus: Charming property on lovely grounds. Minus: BER of E1 is rather low.
