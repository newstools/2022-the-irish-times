Sir, – Further to Paul Cullen’s analysis of the Trinity College Dublin and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland report of the differences in the price of medicines from a sample of pharmacies, (News, May 30th) it seems to me that the patient – or paying customer – is badly served by the move to e-prescriptions, introduced during the pandemic, in a number of ways. First, there seems to be no good reason why patients must nominate a pharmacy to which their doctor will send a first or repeat prescription rather than having the choice of receiving it in person, or to their own email address, and then easily shop around without any fuss or embarrassment. Second, many GP practices have introduced charges of around €25 for issuing a repeat prescription. To add insult to injury health insurers, or at least my own insurer Laya, does not regard this as a qualifying medical expense eligible for part-reimbursement under my current policy’s terms and conditions. – Yours, etc, VINCENT BOURKE, Bray, Co Wicklow.
