Sligo footballer Red Óg Murphy has died aged 21. The vastly talented 21-year-old was studying to be a teacher in DCU, where he also starred on the university’s football team. In 2019, he returned to Sligo from a stint as a professional footballer in the AFL with North Melbourne, after less than 12 months of a two-year contract citing a lack of love for the game. He featured in all 12 of Sligo’s league and championship games throughout 2020 and 2021, scoring 1-15, but opted out of Tony McEntee’s 2022 panel so he could focus on his studies and club commitments. Considered one of the country’s finest young GAA players, he first came to prominence in schools football with St Attracta’s in Tubbercurry and was this year named on the Sigerson team of the year. In tribute, Enniscrone/Kilglass GAA club wrote on Twitter “Everyone in @enniskilgaa would like to offer our deepest sympathies to the family, friends of Red Og Murphy and all in @currygaaclub on this tragic day. You are all in our thoughts and prayers. #sligogaa.” Curry GAA Club announced that games today were cancelled.
