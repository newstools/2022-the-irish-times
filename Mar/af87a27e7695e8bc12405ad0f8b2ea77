This week two wines from South America; both feature in the latest SuperValu promotion which started this week and lasts until the April 6th. Both Sauvignon and Malbec are amongst our favourite grape varieties and these are good examples of the genre. If you fancy being as little bit adventurous, you could try out two German wines at very competitive prices; the Albert Glas Riesling and Pinot Noir, both €10 a bottle, offer good value for money. Aresti Trisquel Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc 2021, Leyda Valley, Chile Chile produces some very good Sauvignon Blanc, especially from cooler regions such as the Leyda Valley. This wine has lifted aromas of flowers and herbs with concentrated tropical fruits, citrus peel and asparagus on the lively palate. Try it with Thai green curries, or herby mussels. €10.70 down from €15.99 Doña Paula Estate Malbec 2021 Uco Valley, Argentina Seductive lifted violet aromas, medium to full-bodied with blackcurrant and plum fruits edged with spice, and well-integrated ripe tannins on the finish. Try it with a rare steak, a posh burger (veggie or beef). At €10 (down from €15.99) this is outstanding value.
