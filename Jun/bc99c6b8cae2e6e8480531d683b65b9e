Australia are to involve Japan-based trio Quade Cooper, Samu Kerevi and Marika Koroibete in next month’s three-Test series against England. Under the new terms of the ‘Giteau Law’, Wallabies coach Dave Rennie is able to select three players competing in overseas leagues. Cooper, Kerevi and Koroibete will bring versatility and firepower to the backline for the series that begins in Perth on July 2nd as Australia look to end a run of eight successive defeats by Eddie Jones’ England. “It’s probably not that secret anyway but we’ve got Quade, Samu and Marika all coming back,” Rennie said. “Quade and Samu are here in Sydney just getting medical checks and Marika went straight to Fiji to spend some time with his family and he’ll be back on the weekend. “Marika is one of the best wingers in the world – I’m not sure there’s another winger with his work ethic and repeatability. He’s just top gear all day so we’re looking forward to getting that back. “Samu only played a few Tests but was nominated for World Rugby player of the year in 2021, which only highlights the impact he had. “You look at Quade, he had a massive impact with us and was a really calming influence. He was so impressive with the group.”
