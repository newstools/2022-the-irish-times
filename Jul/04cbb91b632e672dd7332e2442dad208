Kieran Kingston has stepped down as manager of the Cork hurlers. His latest term has been for the past three seasons and despite being offered a one-year extension he has decided to call time on a second appointment. This season ended two weeks ago in disappointment after defeat by Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final. Kingston’s previous term as manager came in the 2016 and ‘17 seasons, having also served separately as coach and selector for Jimmy Barry-Murphy a decade ago. The statement on Cork GAA’s website on Sunday was as follows: “Cork GAA officers have been informed by Cork senior hurling manager Kieran Kingston that he will not be seeking a further term in the role. “All in Cork GAA wish to sincerely acknowledge Kieran’s years of dedication across a whole range of positions, including the roles of player, selector, coach and of course, manager. “Having initially served as selector (2012-2013) and coach (2014) under Jimmy Barry-Murphy, Kieran was appointed manager for the 2016 and 2017 seasons, before returning in the same role for three further years, from 2020 to 2022. “Over that time, he has been present on the line, as selector and manager in 2013 and 2021, respectively, for Cork’s only two All-Ireland senior final appearances of the last sixteen years. He also coached and managed the team to Munster success in 2014 and 2017, respectively. “The incredible contribution of Kieran’s backroom team over the past three years is also acknowledged and while the success that all deserved may not have followed, they can hold their heads high, knowing that they served their county.”
