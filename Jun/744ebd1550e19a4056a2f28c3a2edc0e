Sir, – The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) has the policy of dating renewal not from the date of expiry of the licence as one would expect but from the date of application which NDLS itself provides can be three months ahead of expiry date. If a prudent person applies three months early, they lose three months on their licence. I have lost weeks in two renewals and I know of people who have lost months. By contrast, this June I had also to renew my public services card and also did so early. I have just had an email from MyWelfare informing me that my renewal application has been successfully submitted and “Your new Public Services Card will be issued nearer to the expiry date of your existing card. If your Public Services Card is already expired, your new card will issue shortly”. NDLS please copy. – Yours, etc, DECLAN O’DONOVAN, Dalkey, Co Dublin.
