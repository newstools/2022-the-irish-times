The tail end of the first Atlantic tropical storm is to bring rain and heavy winds to Ireland over Thursday and Friday, with the unsettled weather to continue over the weekend, Met Éireann has said. Tropical storm Alex initially hit Florida in the United States causing flooding in recent days before moving over Bermuda and is now passing by Ireland. Conall Ruth, meteorologist with Met Éireann, said the ex-tropical storm was responsible for the heavy rain and wind in parts of the country on Thursday. The rainfall was “heavy enough in places but not too out of the ordinary” and was not currently significant enough to trigger a yellow rain or wind weather warning, he said. “Already we are seeing strong winds over the country, it will be quite windy as the storm skims by,” he said. The worst of the bad weather brought on by the storm would likely be the heavy rain on Thursday, he said. A period of heavy rain and wind would not be unusual for June, he added. Despite the impacts of the passing storm Met Éireann has forecast highest temperatures of up to 21 degrees in the east of the country for Thursday. Friday is due to be a breezy and blustery day with widespread rain showers, according to the national forecaster. Highest temperatures will be between 15 and 19 degrees, with strongest winds in the west of the country along the coast. The unsettled weather will continue to bring a likelihood of rain showers over the rest of the weekend. On Saturday, the west and north of the country will see persistent rain, but temperatures may still reach highs of 18 degrees in some areas. The rain is expected to begin to ease off from Sunday with Met Éireann forecasting some dry sunny spells between light showers. While the outlook for Monday is a cloudy day with some rain showers, the forecaster has said.
