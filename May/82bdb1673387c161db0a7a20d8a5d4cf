Erik ten Hag will arrive in Manchester on Monday to start preparations for his job as Manchester United’s manager. The Dutchman, who was appointed on April 22nd as the permanent replacement to Ole Gunnar Solskjær, had his final game as Ajax manager on Sunday, having already led them to the Dutch title. He will hold discussions with United personnel and begin acquainting himself with the club but Ralf Rangnick will continue as interim manager for the final game of the season at Crystal Palace. United are sixth and cannot finish higher. When Solskjær was sacked in November, Michael Carrick took over as caretaker for an unbeaten three-match spell before Rangnick replaced him. Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag’s assistant at Ajax, will be part of the new coaching staff, and they hope that Steve McClaren, a former assistant to Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, will join them. - Guardian
