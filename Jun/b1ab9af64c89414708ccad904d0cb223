Sir, – Cllr John Kennedy (Letters, June 29th) sings the praises of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council and its record in resolving issues which “may be of paramount importance local residents”. Presumably he includes wheelchair users, of which I am one, when he refers to local residents. A few years ago, when I lived in my native Monkstown, two disabled parking spaces close to the local convenience store were arbitrarily removed without notice or consultation. I wrote individually to all the councillors to complain about the situation. Those who replied indicated that they were unaware that this had happened. They had not been informed, much less consulted. There are two issues at play here; the low order of priority given to issues concerning disabled people and the taking of decisions on matters affecting local citizens by non-elected officials without reference to elected representatives. – Yours, etc, SEAN O’DONNELL, Ardee, Co Louth. Sir, – Cllr John Kennedy gave an “example” of local democracy when he mentioned a “debate surrounding the installation of bicycle lanes in Deansgrange”. The fact is that Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, during the years 2020-2022, bypassed Part 8 planning applications for construction of bicycle lanes in Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Dundrum, and Deansgrange. Rather like the present situation in Dublin’s Sandymount, where Dublin City Council is attempting to develop the seafront without planning permission, the only recourse available that local democracy has is for concerned residents to take expensive legal action in the High Court. It was this threat of legal action by the Deansgrange residents that actually put a stop to all the illegal road developments that Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council undertook. – Yours, etc, DAMIAN O’REGAN, Blackrock, Co Dublin.
