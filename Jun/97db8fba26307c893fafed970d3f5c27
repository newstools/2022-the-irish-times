A chara, – Today I received a bill from Electric Ireland. The daily standing charge increased from 50.4c to 68.38c or 35.7 per cent. The unit price increased from 21.12c to 25.8c or 22.2 per cent. The “free electricity” allowance remained unchanged at €1.06 a day – enough for just over 1½ units of electricity after the standing charge is paid. Government decision or indecision? – Mise le meas, JOHN HEARN, Malahide, Co Dublin.
