€6,500 (plus VAT) Covid may not be the threat it once was, but it hasn’t gone away. And neither has the recently acquired knowledge about the importance of adequate air filtration indoors, for that matter. Early in the pandemic, Irish company Wellair unveiled its NV200 device, which it had tested against Covid-19 surrogates, as a potential weapon in the fight against airborne pathogens. Now it is back with another device, the Defend 400, which is designed for mid-sized spaces. The Defend 400 uses a four-stage pathogen inactivation and filtration system that will tackle everything from the virus we’ve been living with for two years to fungi and mould spores, cleaning the air. It’s not a cheap fix, but it offers a way for offices, schools, gyms, entertainment venues and other spaces to keep their air quality in tip-top shape without generating any potentially harmful byproducts. novaerus.ie
