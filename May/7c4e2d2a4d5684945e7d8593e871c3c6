Dublin’s Aviva Stadium will host the 2023 Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup finals, European Professional Club Rugby has announced. The two showpiece matches, will take place in the Irish capital on Friday, May 19th and Saturday, May 20th, 2023. The 2023 finals will return to Dublin after a decade when RC Toulon defeated ASM Clermont Auvergne to lift the Champions Cup trophy in 2013. Dominic McKay, EPCR Chairman, said: “Following extensive discussions with all stakeholders, including the Aviva Stadium, Dublin City Council and the IRFU, we are delighted to be bringing the Heineken Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup Finals back to Dublin next May. “The ground has a strong association with EPCR, having staged three finals over the years, and we are very much looking forward to returning to Dublin.” The 2023 Finals were originally scheduled to be staged at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, however, with the Premier League concluding later than usual due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup taking place in November and December, coupled with the impact of Rugby World Cup 2023 on the EPCR calendar, it was decided to select the Aviva Stadium as next season’s host venue. This season’s Champions Cup final will take place in Marseille as Leinster take on La Rochelle. Heineken will continue as title sponsors of the Champions Cup, extending a long-standing association with the competition.
