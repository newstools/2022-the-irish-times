Aleš Blažek is stepping down from his role as chief executive of KBC Bank Ireland in May, the Belgian banking group has said. Mr Blažek, who only succeeded Peter Roebben in the Irish role last July, is moving to take over at the head of the bank’s operations in the Czech Republic, where he will replace John Hollows, who is retiring. He will also joined the bank’s executive committee. KBC said a successor to Mr Blažek at the head of the Irish unit as it runs down its business here has been identified and will be announced shortly, once the appointment has been approved by the European Central Bank. The appointment of Mr Blažek as CEO of the Czech business unit has been approved by the Czech National Bank. His approval as member of the executive committee of KBC Group is still subject to approval by the National Bank of Belgium and the European Central Bank. Johan Thijs, KBC Group chief executive, congratulated Mr Blažek on his appointment. “I’m delighted that Aleš has agreed to take over from John as CEO of the Czech business unit,” he said. “As customer experience, innovation and digital transformation have become top priorities, Aleš’ experience at KBC Bank Ireland and earlier as head of data and strategy at CSOB, will prove invaluable in his new role as CEO in Czech Republic and in taking the digital transformation of our operations in that country to the next level.”
