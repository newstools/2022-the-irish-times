1 Toast the chilli flakes, mustard and coriander seeds in a dry pan until fragrant. Crush in a pestle and mortar. 2 Finely slice the white part of the spring onion, reserving the greens for your slaw. 3 Place the pork mince, sausage meat, breadcrumbs, grated garlic, lime zest, butter, sliced spring onion and as much of the spice mix as you like into a large bowl. Season well with salt and pepper and mix to thoroughly combine. 4 Shape the meat into evenly sized patties about the thickness of your finger to ensure they cook evenly on the grill. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. 5 When ready, grill over a medium heat for 10-15 minutes on each side or until cooked through. 1 Finely slice the spring onion greens set aside from your burger. 2 In a small bowl, mix together the hot sauce, mayo, mustard and scallions. 3 Using a grater, shred the cabbage and carrot into a large bowl. 4 Add the lime juice and a good pinch of salt to the cabbage and carrot and mix to combine – leave to soften for five minutes. 5 Mix in the chilli mayo, making sure to reserve some for later. 1 If using a whole pineapple, cut into quarters and remove the woody core. 2 Brush the pineapple with some oil and sprinkle with the brown sugar and a crack of black pepper. 3 Grill the pineapple over a high heat until the sugar has caramelised - be careful not to burn it. 4 Carefully remove the pineapple skin and roughly chop the flesh. 1 Gently toast the bun. 2 Spread some of your reserved chilli mayo on the bottom bun. 3 Then add the caramelised pineapple, burger and finally top with the slaw.
