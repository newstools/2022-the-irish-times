England football fans in Munich have been arrested for making Nazi salutes and for damaging a hotel room before Tuesday’s Nations League tie with Germany, local police said. Eight England fans were arrested on Monday, largely in the downtown area of Munich. Three were arrested for making Nazi salutes and police said another fan caused an estimated €2,000 (£1,700) damage after he let off a flare in his hotel room. Four others were arrested for incidents including insulting police officers and urinating in the street. Many of the troublemakers were dealt with by being ordered to pay a security deposit of about €200 – the local equivalent of an on-the-spot fine – and two unable to pay the money were brought before a district judge. Some bars in the city closed early on Monday after becoming overwhelmed by the number of customers as large groups of fans wearing England replica shirts and carrying flags sang in the warm German sunshine. Other pubs did not open on Tuesday after reports of incidents getting out of hand among some supporters. Police were called to one “brawl” on Monday, reported to have involved 30 to 50 England fans, but said it had dispersed by the time armed officers arrived. There are fears of further clashes on Tuesday after some England fans bought tickets in the Germany sections of the Allianz Arena. A Munich police spokesman said police would be able to stop England fans from going in the “home” areas only if there was an expectation they may cause trouble. He said that 700 police officers had been deployed to deal with the influx of England fans to the city since Saturday, considerably more than would be working for a Bayern Munich match. England’s manager, Gareth Southgate, has pleaded with fans to behave. The Football Association has been hit by a two-game stadium ban, with one suspended, after the violence at the Euro 2020 final last July.
