Sir, – While it is good to see help being given to first-time buyers in the form of an equity stake by the State, this scheme does nothing to reduce the price of a home and may actually bring price increases as developers factor in a buyer’s increased spending power (“Government’s ¤400 million scheme for first-time buyers set to open”, News, July 7th). The Government should be looking to reduce the cost of providing homes in the first place, and a large contributor to that cost is the price of rezoned land. When is Government going to tackle the blindingly obvious artificial cost increase that rezoned land adds to the price of new developments? – Yours, etc, DAVID DORAN, Bagenalstown, Co Carlow.
