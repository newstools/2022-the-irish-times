Russia has probably renewed its efforts to advance south of Ukraine’s eastern city of Izium in the last 48 hours, Britain’s defence ministry said on Saturday. Its goal is to penetrate deeper into the Donetsk region and envelope the pocket around the embattled city of Severodonetsk from the north, it said on Twitter. If trapped Ukrainian civilians do not take up an offer of leaving via a corridor, Russia is likely to claim justification in making less of a distinction between them and any Ukrainian military targets in the area, the ministry added. Elsewhere, more than 70 miners have been trapped in a coal mine in Donetsk after power to the pit was cut. Russian state news agency RIA blamed the incident on Ukraine, accusing it of launching attacks in the eastern region causing the power failure, according to Reuters. “As a result of shelling [by Ukrainian forces], power to the Zasyadko mine in Donetsk was cut off, and 77 miners remain underground,” RIA said. Reuters could not immediately verify the report, and there was no immediate reaction from Ukraine As war rages in Ukraine’s east, Kyiv received a major boost on Friday when the European Union recommended that it become a candidate to join the bloc, foreshadowing a dramatic geopolitical shift in the wake of Russia’s invasion. At a summit next week, EU leaders are expected to endorse the recommendations by the bloc's executive for Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Twitter the bravery of Ukrainians had brought an opportunity for Europe to “create a new history of freedom, and finally remove the grey zone in eastern Europe between the EU and Russia”. As diplomacy advanced with Brussels, intense fighting continued in the eastern region of Donbas, where Russia seeks to solidify and extend recent gains, while British prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to the capital, Kyiv. Mr Zelenskiy said in a nightly televised address that the decision of EU member states remains to be seen, but added: “You can only imagine truly powerful European strength, European independence and European development with Ukraine.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision while wearing the Ukrainian colours, represented by a yellow blazer over a blue blouse. "Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective," she said. "We want them to live with us the European dream." Russian president Vladimir Putin attacked at the West, the United States in particular, in a grievance-filled speech in St Petersburg, but he sought to play down the EU issue. "We have nothing against it," he said. "It is not a military bloc. It's the right of any country to join economic union." Ukraine applied to join the EU four days after Russian troops poured across its border late in February. Within days it was joined by Moldova and Georgia, smaller former Soviet states also contending with separatist regions backed by Russia. Although only the start of a process that may run for years and require extensive reforms, the move by the European Commission puts Kyiv on course to realise an aspiration seen as out of reach just months ago.

But Friday’s announcement underlined how the war has had the opposite effect: convincing Finland and Sweden to join Nato, and now the EU to embark on potentially its most ambitious expansion since welcoming eastern European states after the Cold War. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the West not to “suggest peace initiatives with unacceptable terms”, in an apparent reference to remarks this month by French president Emmanuel Macron that finding a diplomatic solution requires not humiliating Russia. Instead, Mr Kuleba wrote in an online article in the magazine Foreign Policy, the West should help Ukraine win, not just by providing heavy weapons but by maintaining and increasing sanctions against Moscow. "The West cannot afford any sanctions fatigue, regardless of the broader economic costs," he wrote. "It is clear that Putin's path to the negotiating table lies solely through battleground defeats." Since Ukraine defeated Russia’s bid to storm Kyiv in March, Moscow has refocused on the eastern Donbas region, which it claims on behalf of separatist proxies, and its forces have used their artillery advantage to blast their way into cities in a punishing phase of the war. However, Russia’s military is “suffering heavy casualties” after concentrating the vast majority of its available combat power to capture Severodonetsk and its sister city, Lysychansk, at the expense of other axes of advance, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said on Friday. — Reuters (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022
