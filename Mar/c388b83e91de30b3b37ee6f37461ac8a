Edinson Cavani is set to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer and the striker’s preferred option would be to join a club in Spain. The 35-year-old Uruguayan has played in Italy, France and England and wants to experience another of Europe’s major leagues. Cavani has received approaches, including from La Liga clubs. Cavani joined United from Paris Saint-Germain in October 2020 and signed a one-year contract extension last May after scoring 15 goals in his first season. He talked then about achieving “special things” this season but the campaign has not unfolded as he or the club had hoped. United have been off the pace in domestic competitions – they remain in contention in the Champions League – and Cavani has been restricted by injuries to 15 appearances, scoring twice. He has not played for almost a month because of a groin strain. There have been rumours that Cavani could join River Plate because the Argentinian club will need a replacement for Julián Álvarez, who is joining Manchester City, but that is not where he sees his future. - Guardian
