Telecoms company Three Ireland said it was working to restore full service to customers after reports of “intermittent difficulties” with data services. Customers took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the issue, which appeared to affect its mobile network and broadband customers. “We’re aware that some Three customers are currently experiencing intermittent difficulties with their data services,” the company said in a post on its social media account. “Our tech team are working to restore full service as soon as possible.” It is not known how many customers have been affected by the issue, but DownDetector saw a spike in reports of problems around 10.30am, with thiusands of reports logged at the site. Three Ireland has an active customer base of 3.1 million as of the end of 2021, a rise of 500,00 over the year, and is the country’s biggest mobile network according to ComReg figures. It now claims a market share of almost 40 per cent, putting it ahead of Vodafone at almost 36 per cent. That figure includes mobile broadband and machine to machine subscriptions; when those services were excluded, figures from ComReg showed Three Ireland was second to Vodafone, at 30 per cent to its rival’s 35.5 per cent.
