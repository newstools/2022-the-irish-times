Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is deeply saddened to learn of the death of former Fianna Fáil press director Tom Reddy. Mr Reddy was previously a news reporter and European correspondent for Independent newspapers, and former director of Goal, the international humanitarian organisation. He served as press director and communications manager for Fianna Fáil for five years, before later becoming a ministerial adviser to Mary Coughlan during her time as Minister for Social and Family Affairs and Minister for Agriculture and Food. According to his online death notice, Mr Reddy died on Monday at Our Lady’s Hospice, Harold’s Cross, Dublin. “Sadly missed by his son Austin and daughter Erin, his sister Kate (Catherine), his close cousins Mary McNamara and Tommy O’Dwyer, his nieces Jane, Maria and Emily, extended family, relatives and friends,” it states. Mr Reddy’s funeral Mass will take place on Wednesday morning at Thurles parish. Commenting on his death, Mr Martin said he was “very sorry to learn of the very sad passing today of Tom Reddy, a talented journalist, an astute political analyst and a thorough gentleman”. “An intelligent and warm man, he gave willingly of his time and his advice and insight was always greatly valued,” he said. “On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil organisation, I want to express my deepest condolences to the Reddy family at this very difficult time.” In recent years Mr Reddy earned a masters in screenwriting for TV and film at the national film school at the Institute of Art Design and Technology. He is also the author of three non-fiction books, including a definitive account of the 2011 Irish presidential election entitled Race for the Áras.
