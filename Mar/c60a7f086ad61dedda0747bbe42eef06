Subsidy rates for the State’s Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) have been reduced to €100 per employee per week. This comes as the Government continues phasing out the scheme, which is due to end completely on April 30th. From February, the original two-rate structure of €203 a week and €151.50 a week applied under the EWSS. This now falls to €100 per week for the next two months. As of last week, some 22,500 employers were still registered for the EWSS, which was introduced to support businesses impacted by the Covid crisis. More than €6.5 billion has been spent by the Government so far on the scheme with the accomodation and food services sector the biggest recipient, followed by the wholesale and retail trade. As of Tuesday, March 1st, the full rate of employer’s PRSI is also being reinstated. During the pandemic, a reduced rate of 0.5 per cent had applied to wages eligible for the subsidy.
