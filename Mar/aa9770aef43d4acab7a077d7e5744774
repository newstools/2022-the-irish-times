Six Scotland players have been disciplined following a breach of team protocols in the aftermath of last Saturday’s Six Nations victory in Italy. The BBC has reported that British & Irish Lions trio Finn Russell, Stuart Hogg and Ali Price, as well as Sione Tuipulotu, Darcy Graham and Sam Johnson, incurred the wrath of team management after they left the team hotel to head to a bar in Edinburgh following their return from Rome. The Scottish Rugby Union acknowledged a disciplinary issue had arisen but declined to confirm the identity of the players. A statement read: “The Scotland management team have this week dealt with a post-match matter involving six players following the game against Italy last weekend. “The players involved have been spoken to individually and those conversations and outcomes will remain private. “Preparations for the match against Ireland this week have been good and the whole squad is fully focused on achieving a positive result on Saturday.” Of the six players allegedly in question, captain Hogg, Graham, Johnson and Price, who won his 50th cap it Italy, are all in the starting XV for Saturday’s match against Ireland in Dublin, while Russell was a surprise omission from Gregor Townsend’s team, with the talismanic outhalf starting on the bench. Tuipulotu has been released to play for Glasgow against Edinburgh in the United Rugby Championship on Friday evening.
