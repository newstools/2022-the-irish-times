Galway great Joe Canning’s family hurley business has announced it is to close due to a persistent disease affecting the availability of ash wood. Ash dieback has been described by Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, as a serious disease affecting trees caused by a fungal pathogen. In a statement posted on Twitter, CanningsHurleys, based in Co Galway, said the ongoing problem had caused insurmountable supply chain problems, forcing them to shut down operations. According to the GAA, the condition threatens to kill off 90 per cent of Irish trees and no other wood is as suitable for making hurleys. “We cannot compromise the quality of our products to continue to meet demand with the current ash supply issues potentially due to worsen in the future,” Canning Hurleys said in its statement. The company was established in 2010 and has made handcrafted hurleys in its Portumna workshop using what its website refers to as “the finest quality ash”. “Initially supplying quality handmade hurleys to individuals, clubs and sports retailers throughout the country, interest from foreign markets has led to the company exporting hurleys throughout the UK, Canada and the United States,” it said. The website did not have any indication of a cessation in production.
