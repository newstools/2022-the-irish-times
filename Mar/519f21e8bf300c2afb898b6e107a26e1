Premium fashion group Flannels has signed a deal for its second Dublin store. Having committed earlier this year to occupy half the retail space at the Clerys Quarter on O’Connell Street, the luxury retailer is to open for business at the Blanchardstown Centre. Flannels, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, will occupy the ground floor of the former Debenhams unit. At 45,000sq ft, the space will be the larger of the two outlets committed to by the retailer in the Irish market to date. Flannels’ premises at the redeveloped Clerys store will extend to 30,000sq ft. Commenting on the opening of the latest store, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said: “We’re excited to open Flannels in Blanchardstown and bring a world-class shopping experience to a new destination. Our ambitious expansion plans mark a pivotal moment for the business, and we’re pleased to be opening in Blanchardstown as part of our next cohort of store openings in Ireland.” ‘Ongoing strategy’ Pat Nash, managing director at the west Dublin retail scheme’s asset manager Falcon AM, added: “Flannels’ commitment to a new lease in Blanchardstown Centre is a huge endorsement of the scheme and follows the completion of a major €17 million mall refurbishment. This is in line with our ongoing strategy to strengthen and reposition the asset . We are excited to be welcoming new retailers to the centre and indeed the Irish market during these unpredictable times.” Falcon AM made the decision to split the Debenhams’ unit, which comprises more than 100,000sq ft in its entirety, to meet with current retailer demand according to the firm’s leasing director, Sharon Walsh. Ms Walsh said that a further announcement will be made in relation to the upper level of Debenhams’ former premises in the coming weeks. BNP Paribas Real Estate and Bannon are the joint leasing agents for the Blanchardstown Centre.
