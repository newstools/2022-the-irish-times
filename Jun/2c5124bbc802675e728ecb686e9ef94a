Sir – With reference to the article on June 8th, on the Home Economics Leaving Cert paper, it was suggested that the appearance of topics such as mortgages, veganism and vitamin D, reflect life in Ireland in 2022. What was quite disturbing was the appearance of a question related to body image that clearly reflects harmful ideologies ever-present in Ireland, promoting body dissatisfaction. I quote higher-level question: “Discuss how colour can be used to flatter body size and shape.” Thousands of students read that question. What kind of message does a question like that communicate to adolescents? It blatantly points to the appearance ideal of thinness for women that is pervasive in our society. How is knowing the answer to such a question even deemed relevant in equipping these adolescents for their future life progression? Adolescents are more vulnerable to body image issues and more impressionable at this pivotal stage of development. The problem of disordered eating and body image issues is fuelled by the harmful messages in our society and they are evident nearly everywhere! It is very disappointing for such a question to have been allowed and proofed for the exam especially given the significant rise in eating disorders in Ireland since the pandemic. – Yours, etc, GRACE HARRISON, Adult and adolescent psychotherapist, Ennis, Co Clare.
