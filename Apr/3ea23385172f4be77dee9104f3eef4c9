Cairn Homes is to lodge plans in the coming days for a 366-home scheme for Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, in Blackrock, south Dublin. According to a statutory planning notice, Cairn Homes Properties Ltd is looking to build 355 build-to-rent apartments across six blocks ranging in height from three to eight storeys on the 7.9-acre site, as well as 11 homes for sale. The build-to-rent apartments comprise 26 studios, 138 one-bed apartments, 163 two-bed apartments and 28 three-bed units. The proposal involves a 67 per cent increase in the number of homes over a previously planned 221-unit Cairn Homes scheme for the Chesterfield site. That proposal secured the go-ahead from An Bord Pleanála but the planning permission was quashed by the High Court in July 2019 after it was challenged by the Southwood Park Residents Association. The new scheme also includes three build-to-sell apartments within a reconstructed Chesterfield House, and eight 2½-storey four-bedroom semi-detached homes for sale to the north of Chesterfield House. An “amenities hub” to accommodate a range of uses including a gym, aerobics room, residents’ lounge and chef’s kitchen forms part of the proposal as well as “build-to-rent” amenity services. Separately, An Bord Pleanála has granted planning permission to fast track plans to Palemink Ltd for a 190-unit build-to-rent scheme for the former Siemens site at the corner of Ballymoss Road and Blackthorn Avenue in Sandyford Business District, Dublin 18. The scheme will involve two 15-storey high blocks, with 92 one-bed, 86 two-bed and 12 three-bed apartments. Permission was granted over the recommendation of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council planners that it be refused . The board found that the proposed development would constitute an acceptable quantum and density of development in a highly accessible urban location and would be acceptable in terms of urban design, height and quantum of development.
