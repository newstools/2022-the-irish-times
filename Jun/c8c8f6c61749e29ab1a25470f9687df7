It made them the youngest people in the history of the State to be convicted of murder. In a brief statement outside the courthouse after the convictions in November 2019, Mr Kriégel said: “Forever is not long enough. Please remember Ana and keep her in your hearts, somewhere.” [ Ana Kriégel murder trial: The complete story ]
