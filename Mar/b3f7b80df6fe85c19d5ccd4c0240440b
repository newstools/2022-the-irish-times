Homebuilder Cairn Homes said 2021 was a year of strong performance for the company, as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted and construction activity restarted. Operating profit was €58.4 million, more than double the €24.4 million recorded in 2020. The company said it closed 1,120 new home sales during 2021, compared to 743 in the prior year, delivering revenue of €424 million. The second half of the year saw a stronger performance for the company, hitting a record as it completed 717 sales. Average selling price for starter homes was €350,000, despite the increases in costs for building. A final dividend of 2.8 cent per ordinary share for a full year dividend of 5.5 cent per ordinary share is being proposed, subject to shareholder approval. The company said it expected to remain an active homebuilder in the Greater Dublin Area, but it also plans to expand its regional footprint and build in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Limerick in the coming three years. It is targeting more than €500 million in operating cashflow to invest in further growth and increase capital returns to shareholders in the three-year period to the end of 2024. “We have brought multiple new developments through a difficult planning system and we are poised to significantly increase our output over the coming years,” said chief executive Michael Stanley. “We sold our 5,000th home during 2021 in our seventh year in business and we expect to build at least the same number again in the coming three years. Our financial performance enables us to reinvest strongly in our business to drive this significant growth in delivery and to underpin our contribution to addressing the housing needs of our society.”
