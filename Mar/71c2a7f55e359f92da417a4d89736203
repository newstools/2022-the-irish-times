Siptu members of Aer Lingus ground staff have rejected a Labour Court recommendation that granted the company a pay freeze until the end of 2024. The recommendation also backed a proposed permanent 10 per cent pay cut to roster duty allowances. “In real terms, this would mean that our members would experience a four-and-a-half-year pay freeze in total, with pay remaining static since 2019,” said Siptu sector organiser, Niall Phillips. “Like many workers in the aviation sector, our members in Aer Lingus were severely affected by Covid-19 with many working significantly reduced hours since March 2020 and only returning to 100 per cent of their contracted hours in November 2021. While our members accept that Aer Lingus suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, our members also suffered very significant reductions in income during the same period.” Latest rejection The latest rejection comes only months after workers refused to back a Covid-19 recovery document to reduce costs and change work practices to offset losses incurred by the airline during the pandemic. Siptu’s transport, energy, aviation and construction division organiser Karan O Loughlin said rising inflation had compounded the problem for its members. IAG-owned British Airways recently agreed a 10 per cent pay increase for workers for 2022. Union representatives have sought a meeting with senior Aer Lingus management to discuss recent developments.
