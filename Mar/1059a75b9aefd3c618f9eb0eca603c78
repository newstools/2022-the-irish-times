Huawei MateView €600 Remember when your computer monitor was just something that was there? The bar has been raised, and it isn’t going back down any time soon. The Huawei MateView meets that high bar. The monitor is sleek, sophisticated and comes bearing ports. Specifically, it includes USB-C, two regular USB ports, HDMI and MiniDP interfaces, with USB C power. The display gives you 28.2in of 4K display for you to play around with. Bezels are kept to a minimum, and the monitor boasts cinema-level colour gamut and high dynamic range, which should give you excellent graphics. It also supports wireless projection, if you are using Huawei’s HarmonyOS on your smartphone. Nice package All in all, it’s a nice package to have sitting on your desk. However, there has to be a bit of perspective. Is the Huawei MateView a nice monitor? Sure. It looks great, the colour is brilliant and it gives you plenty of space for working across multiple applications. Is it necessary for the average office worker? If you are a designer or someone who works with other creative elements in your job, the Huawei MateView is a good choice. Likewise if you want a monitor that will work for your day job as well as double up for a decent streaming screen or a bit of gaming, then you might be able to justify spending almost €600 on a monitor. For everyone else, it might be an expense too far. harveynorman.ie
