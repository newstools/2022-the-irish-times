Munster’s injury issues ahead of their Heineken Champions Cup game against the Exeter Chiefs were exacerbated by two late defections as Simon Zebo and Diarmuid Barron were forced to withdraw having come down with gastroenteritis problems. This follows on an absentee list that includes Dave Kilcoyne, Tadhg Beirne, Peter O’Mahony, Gavin Coombes, Joey Carbery and Andrew Conway. Shane Daly comes in on the left wing to replace Zebo while 21-year-old Scott Buckley is promoted to the bench for Barron. Buckley was a try scorer on his European debut against Wasps at the Ricoh arena in December and is a member of the Munster academy.
