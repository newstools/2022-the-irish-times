Sir, – We must address our problems of climate change and housing urgently. This will increase total Government borrowing, and interest rates have begun to rise. There is an alternative. Many households have savings on deposit – a total of €136 billion at end 2021 according to the Central Bank – and earning next to nothing. Why does the State not set up a “Better Future” savings fund through An Post and let our savings help to finance urgent and essential investment? Savings would be secure, earn some interest and, most importantly, be put to good use in funding our future and helping us to be more self-sufficient as a people. – Yours, etc, MARGARET QUINLAN, Ballymacarbry, Co Waterford.
