The owner of a well-known estate in Co Cavan has brought a High Court challenge against Bord Pleanála’s decision to grant planning permission allowing a milk powder plant to extend its manufacturing facility. The action has been brought by John Moreharte, who owns the historic and protected Bellamont Castle in Cootehill, Co Cavan, and surrounding 1,000 acres of land which, he claims, includes Dromore lake and river. He is challenging the board’s decision to allow Abbott Ireland extend an existing facility that manufactures milk products for infants which is exported all over the world. Monaghan County Council granted permission for the extension, which was appealed by both Mr Moreharte and An Taisce to the board. Represented by Evan O’Donnell, instructed by Harrington solicitors, Mr Moreharte says his property is 1km from the facility in Dromore, Co Monaghan. He claims the decision to grant planning permission is flawed on grounds including that the board failed to consider the proposed development in the context of its obligations under the EU environmental impact assessment directive. It is also claimed that the board acted contrary to the EU directive on habitats. Abbott Ireland and Monaghan County Council are notice parties to the proceedings. The matter was mentioned before Mr Justice Charles Meenan at the High Court on Monday, who adjourned the matter to a date later this month.
