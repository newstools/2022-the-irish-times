Businesses using the services of Stripe, the online payments company founded by John and Patrick Collison, processed more than $640 billion (€588 billion) in payments last year, the brothers said in an update on Friday. This marked a 60 per cent increase on 2020, but the Collisons noted that much of the growth came from “one-time behavioural adjustments caused by the pandemic” and cautioned that 2022 would not deliver the same level of expansion. They said some 1,400 new companies and non-profit organisations started using Stripe’s services during 2021, observing that a significantly larger market has yet to be tapped by the company. “Online spending was only 12 per cent of global spend in 2021. There’s a long way to go,” they said. Stripe’s most recent funding round valued the company at $95 billion, making it the most valuable private company in Silicon Valley. It now employs more than 7,000 people across 23 countries, including Ireland.
