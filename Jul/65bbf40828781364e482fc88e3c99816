Bala Town (Wales) 1 Sligo Rovers 2 (Mendes 6)(Keena 29, Mata 49) Sligo Rovers came from behind against Welsh opponents Bala Town to put themselves in the driving seat of their Europa Conference League first round qualifying tie in Oswestry. In front of a large crowd of travelling fans, Aidan Keena and Max Mata scored in each half as the Bit O’ Red survived the concession of an early goal — and a late sending-off — to claim the advantage in advance of the second leg at the Showgrounds next Thursday. John Russell’s side endured a nervy start against the Welsh part-timers, and were behind inside six minutes. New Zealand international Nando Pijnaker would be later shown a red card, and he was also caught out for the opening goal, as he failed to deal with a Bala raid, and Lassana Mendes finished confidently for the home side. But the visitors settled into the game after this, and Mata saw a header come back off the post. The equaliser came on the half-hour as Keena controlled a ball over the top and brilliantly chipped the keeper from inside the area for his 12th goal this season. Mata claimed what proved to be the winner after a bright start to the second half from the Bit O’ Red. His initial effort was deflected out for a corner, but he was perfectly positioned to finish from the resultant set-piece, after Bala failed to clear. Pijnaker was shown red for a last-man challenge after he was caught in possession on 79 minutes, but the away side hung on to claim the win.

Sligo Rovers: McGinty, Horgan, Blaney, Pijnaker, Kirk, Morahan, McDonnell (Cawley 90), Fitzgerald, O’Sullivan (Liivak 69), Keena, Mata (Banks 82). Referee: J Barcelo.
