The four-star Gresham hotel on Dublin’s O’Connell Street last year recorded pretax profits of €1.57 million. The Gresham Hotel Company Ltd returned to profit after revenues increased by 38 per cent from €5.6 million to €7.78 million in the 12 months to the end of December last. However, during the hotel’s second Covid-19-impacted year, revenues remained some way off the pre-pandemic revenues of €21.19 million recorded in 2019. The pretax profit of €1.57 million last year followed pre-tax losses of €1.53 million in 2020. The firm only recorded the pretax profit in 2021 after receiving Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme payments of €2.7 million last year which appear as “other operating income’” on the company’s profit and loss account. The company received Covid-19 wage subsidy payments of €715,688 in 2020. The firm did not pay out a dividend last year after paying dividends of €6.1 million in 2020 to parent firm Ryan Travel Holdings Ltd. The pretax profit for 2021 takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of €1.56 million. At year end, that hotel firm’s shareholder funds totalled €48.5 million that included accumulated profits of €39.13 million. The directors state that they were satisfied “with the level of retained reserves at year end”.

Numbers employed increased from 188 to 205 as staff costs rose from €3 million to €3.3 million.
