A man had been shot in the leg in a supermarket carpark in north Dublin. The victim suffered non-life threatening injuries when a gunman opened fire in the carpark on St Margaret’s Road, Finglas, Dublin 11 on Friday afternoon. He is currently being treated in hospital. Gardaí have preserved the scene for technical examination and the adjoining road has been closed. It is understood the victim, who is aged in his 20s and is from Co Louth, was shot in the lower leg. The investigation is likely to focus on any connection to a feud in the Finglas/Blanchardstown area which has resulted in a series of petrol bombings and shootings in recent months. “Gardaí are currently at the scene of what is believed to be a shooting incident on St Margaret’s Road, Finglas, Dublin 11,” the Garda said in a statement. “A man in his 20s is understood to have suffered non-life threatening injuries.”
