A chara, – The obituary of Vincent Daly (June 25th) describes a “fluent but tolerant Gaeilgeoir”. Would your paper refer to a speaker of any other language as “fluent but tolerant”? Please note also that Irish speakers do not normally refer to themselves as Gaeilgeoirí. We are quite simply Irish speakers and should be described as such. Your editorial team should be aware that the term “Gaeilgeoir” when used by English speakers can carry derogatory connotations, as indicated by the qualification “but tolerant” used in this obituary. – Is mise, CAOILFHIONN NIC PHÁIDÍN, Dún Laoghaire, Co Bhaile Átha Cliath.
