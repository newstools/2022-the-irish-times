(Friday, 7.45) Bohemians v Shelbourne, Dalymount Park Injured on Ireland international duty, goalkeeper James Talbot is out for some time as Bohemians’ search for consistency continues. A repeat of their 4-1 win at Tolka Park in April would be welcome here ahead of next week’s visit to Shamrock Rovers, where Shelbourne’s recent good run ended before the break. Derry City v Drogheda United, Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium Without a win in six, opportunity knocks for Derry to set the tone for the remainder of the season and reignite the title tilt their spring form hinted at. Seven points from their last three games has edged Drogheda clear of relegation danger. Dundalk v Shamrock Rovers, Oriel Park Suspended head coach Stephen O’Donnell watches the top-of-the-table clash from the stand as his in-form Dundalk − six wins and a draw since narrowly losing in Tallaght – host the champions. One defeat in 15 has Rovers eight points clear as they chase three-in-a-row titles. St Patrick’s Athletic v UCD, Richmond Park With just one win in five, a season’s hat-trick of victories over College will be welcomed by St Patrick’s, who have laboured to rediscover their early season spark. An encouraging draw with Sligo before the break proved morale remains strong at bottom-of-the-table UCD in their quest to reel in Finn Harps. Saturday Sligo Rovers v Finn Harps, Showgrounds, 7.45 John Russell takes full-time charge of Sligo for the first time looking to build on four points from his two interim games at the helm. One point from five games has Harps nervously looking over their shoulder in the battle with UCD to avoid automatic relegation.
