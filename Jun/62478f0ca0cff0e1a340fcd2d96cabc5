Sir, – The latest report from the Health Research Board makes for very troubling reading, “Cocaine use by young adults rising, study finds”, (News, June 8th). It seems clear that we are deep in the throes of a drug-use epidemic in this country especially, but not exclusively, among young women and the younger cohort of the population in general. This has been known for some time, as far back as 2016 it was widely reported in the media that an average of two people a day lost their lives due to drug use. What has been done to address this problem in the interim? It would appear not much at all. While it is commendable of the media to continually highlight worrying trends, it means little to grieving families and the young lives that have been tragically and needlessly cut short. There is a serious drug problem in this country that needs to be tackled by all sections of society with urgency, consistency and determination. The price of doing nothing or hoping this problem simply goes away is already too high. – Yours, etc, STEPHEN O’HARA, School Chaplain, Carrowmore, Sligo.
