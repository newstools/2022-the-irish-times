Developers and investors looking to take advantage of the ongoing revival within the north Wicklow town of Bray may be interested in the sale of a high-profile residential site being brought to the market by agent Finnegan Menton. Having served for almost 50 years as the home of the well-known hardware store, Anvil, 22-24 Main Street is being offered for sale at a guide price of €1.5 million. Located within a short walk of the much-anticipated opening of Bray Central, the retail and leisure scheme being developed by Paddy McKillen jnr and Matt Ryan’s Oakmount, the 0.3 acre (0.121 hectare) site has full planning permission for six large townhouses (ranging in size from 111-122sq m) with courtyards, terraces, and surface parking to the rear of the site. The approved scheme also provides for nine apartments comprising a mix of one-, two- and three-beds with access to a roof garden. In addition, there is a ground-floor retail space of 94sq m on Main Street and offices of 70sq m. The scheme was designed by Extend Architects. The site occupies a high-profile position within Bray town centre and is surrounded by a range of local amenities. The town centre is experiencing a strong revival with the aforementioned Bray Central due to open later this year. The scheme will offer a choice of restaurants, a bowling alley, cinema, and retail. In terms of public transport, Bray Dart station is located to the east of the property on Florence Road. In addition, there are numerous Dublin Bus stops and coach services operating to and from the area to Dublin city centre, Dublin Airport and beyond. Mark McCormack of Finnegan Menton says: “We expect there to be good interest in this property. It offers a developer a shovel-ready site in an area where there is strong demand for housing.”
