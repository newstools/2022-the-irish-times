As Saint Patrick’s Day approaches, I feature a few more expensive wines to enjoy with festive dinners over the weekend, or on the day itself. All are new to O’Briens. Pinot Blanc La 4ème Tour 2017, Kuentz-Bas, Alsace Pinot Blanc doesn’t always get the publicity it deserves. In Alsace in France, Alto Adige in Italy, and parts of Germany, Pinot Grigio is much more fashionable. This is a pity as Pinot Blanc can be very good, particularly those from Alsace where it often has a little more body and richness. The Kuentz-Bas version is delicious; lightly smoky aromas, plump, rounded peach and nectarine fruits with a lively acidity. Try it with lightly spicy chicken dishes, quiche Lorraine or onion tart. €16.95 down from €18.95 in O’Briens. Pazo Baión Albariño, 2020, Rías Baixas This has really seductive floral aromas and a lovely richness. It explodes on the palate with textured tropical fruits, cantaloupe melons and citrus, finishing long and dry. Perfect with prawns or seared scallops or a seafood risotto. €23.95 down from €26.95 from O’Briens. Viña Leyda Single Vineyard Cahuil Pinot Noir 2020, Leyda Valley, Chile I have featured the leyda Las Brisas Pinot Noir here before. The Cahuil Pinot is equally good, an elegant wine with mouth-watering red cherry and raspberry fruits with a smoky touch. This would go nicely with grilled pork chops, mushroom risotto, or spicy grilled salmon. €15.95 down from €17.95 in O’Briens. Château Sargant 2019, Lalande-de-Pomerol, Bordeaux A substantial wine (14.5 per cent abv) packed with rich dark fruits swathed in vanilla and woodsmoke, and ripe dark tannins on the finish. One to enjoy with a roast of lamb, or a venison stew. €22.95 down from €25.95 from O’Briens.
