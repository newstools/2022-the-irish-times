Revolut customers around the world have donated more than €1 million in 24 hours to support the victims of the war in Ukraine. The fintech company has enabled customers across the world to make free instant donations to their local Red Cross Ukraine appeal. Revolut chief executive Nik Storonsky said Revolut will match all donations to the appeal. So far, Revolut has enabled donations for users in Lithuania, the UK, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland, Portugal and Singapore. More countries will be added to that list in the coming days. Christopher Guttridge, head of Revolut’s donations team, said: “At this critical moment, our support of the Red Cross in its vital humanitarian efforts enables millions of people worldwide to instantly donate to those affected by the invasion of Ukraine. “We asked our customers to show that our hearts and hands are with those impacted by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and they have responded with incredible generosity. “Everyone at Revolut is proud to be part of a British company with global reach assisting the Ukrainian people in their time of need.” Revolut has also waived fees for remittances to Ukraine, allowing its global customers to send money at no cost to banks in the country.
