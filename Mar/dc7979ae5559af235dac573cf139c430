Northern Ireland firm Xperience has continued its acquisition strategy with the purchase of English cloud and cyber security company Riverlite. The deal brings advanced cloud and cyber security capabilities to the Lisburn-based company. Xperience already has expertise in digital, cloud, cyber security, and managed IT as well as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management software. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it will see the annual turnover of the Lisburn-based company rise from £16 million to £21.5 million, and its headcount increase to 150. “Growth across the UK and Ireland remains a strategic priority, and Riverlite is a natural fit as we share a similar culture and values. Importantly, it achieves a leading presence in the east of England and strengthens our existing team nationally,” said Iain O’Kane, Xperience chief executive. “It also provides another Cyber Security and data platform, which given the events of last year and continued global threats, is a genuine benefit for our clients.” The latest acquisition follows the purchase of Suffolk-based cloud and cyber security experts Green Duck in October, and builds on the company’s network in Lisburn, Co Antrim; Peterborough, England; and Glasgow, Scotland.
