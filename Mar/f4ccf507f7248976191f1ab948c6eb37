1914 and 2022. In mental dug-outs, the arms-trading élite are playing the parts they know, the affluent few hurling their memes like rocks as they retreat from thought and any common explanation of why we are where we are. Their worlds repose on ammunition and money; the whole creation, this azure planet, a mere material cause. What quietness or method can restore Europe and make each choice correlative with something in our situation more than ourselves? Give-and-take and take-and-give to serve both future and historical justice. Real shame before that final cause which only is the poor. To make all well, mercy must give shape to our angular laws.
