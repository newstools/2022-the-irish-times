Developers involved in the delivery of homes in Dublin’s commuter-belt counties are expected to express their interest in a 2.5 hectare (6.17 acre) site which has come to the market in Wicklow Town. Located at Avonvale Manor on the much sought-after Ballynerrin Road, the subject site, which is for sale through joint agents Lisney and REA Forkin at a guide price of €2.75 million, has full planning permission for 31 three- and four-bedroom semi-detached and detached houses. Major infrastructural works have already taken place, which include roads, a sub-station, attenuation tanks, which will ensure speedy delivery of the finished units for the incoming purchaser. In total, 17 of the 31 plots have been fully serviced, with the balance of 14 plots requiring servicing. A full legal and planning pack including drawings is available upon request. The subject site is situated 1.8km west of Wicklow Town. The town itself offers the full range of amenities including schools, retail, leisure, public transport facilities and a varied selection of coffee shops and eateries. Wicklow Town has a proven track record among first-time buyers and those trading up thanks to the quality of its residential offering and relative affordability compared to the Dublin market. The lands are being sold by way of formal tender guiding €2.75 million.
