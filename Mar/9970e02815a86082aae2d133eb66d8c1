Four kayakers were helped ashore by lifeboats off the north Dublin coast on Sunday afternoon after getting into difficultly in strong winds and high seas. Howth RNLI in north Co Dublin launched both its lifeboats in response to reports that six kayakers found themselves in difficulty off the coast of Malahide. One person was reported to have capsized and was struggling in the water amid poor weather conditions with strong easterly winds and one-metre-high seas. Four kayakers were rescued from the sea north of Malahide with two members of Howth inshore lifeboat’s crew entering the water and helping the kayakers ashore at Donabate beach. The other two kayakers made their own way ashore on the southern side of Malahide estuary and were assisted by the Howth Coast Guard Unit. “Thankfully, this call-out in difficult conditions ended well with all kayakers returned safely to shore,” said Howth RNLI inshore lifeboat helm Lorcan Dignam. He urged kayakers to carry a handheld VHF radio or a mobile phone in a waterproof pouch with them in case they find themselves into trouble while out on the sea. “Weather and sea conditions can change very quickly, so it’s really important to check the weather forecast and what the tides are doing before you go out on the water,” he said. The RNLI operates more than 238 lifeboat stations in Ireland and the UK. It is run independently of the coast guard and government and relies on voluntary donations. Since its foundation in 1824, RNLI lifeboat crews and lifeguards are estimated to have saved more than 142,700 lives.
