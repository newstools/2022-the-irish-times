Yeah, But Where Are You Really From? is the new memoir from Irish-Zambian writer Marguerite Penrose. It’s a perfectly apt title for a book that explores the author’s experience of life, beginning in St Patrick’s Mother and Baby Home in Dublin in 1974. In the book, Marguerite writes about coming to terms with the circumstances of her early childhood, about navigating the world with a disability and what it means to be Black and Irish. In today’s episode of The Women’s Podcast, she tells Róisín Ingle about the search for her biological family, about the Instagram post which inspired the book and how she’s embracing life with openness and positivity.
