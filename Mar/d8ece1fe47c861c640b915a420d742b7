There is a tight four-way battle between candidates in the Seanad byelection as counting continues today. Former Ireland rugby star Hugo MacNeill topped the poll in the first count on Wednesday night. Mr MacNeill remained in the lead after the fifth count on Thursday morning, with 2,092 votes. Security analyst Tom Clonan was not far behind on 2,014 and psychologist Maureen Gaffney was on 1,936. Former Green Party lord mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu was in fourth place on Thursday morning, with 1,823 votes. Mr MacNeill was, however, getting fewer transfers than his rivals. A final result is not expected until Thursday evening. There was a larger gap to the candidate in fifth place on Thursday morning, Ursula Quill, who was on 1,226 votes, while entrepreneur Aubrey McCarthy was in sixth place with 977. Sadhbh O’Neill, an assistant professor at Dublin City University, had 909 votes. Catherine Stocker, a Social Democrats councillor in Dublin, was on 548, while barrister Ade Oluborode had 508 votes. In total 17 candidates entered the race for the seat in the University of Dublin constituency left vacant by the election to the Dáil last year of Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik. Voting in the constituency is limited to just less than 68,000 graduates of Trinity College Dublin (TCD). The total number of ballots returned was 13,434, amounting to a turnout of just less than 20 per cent. The valid poll was 13,418 and the quota is 6,710.
