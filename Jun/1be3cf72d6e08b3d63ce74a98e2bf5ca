In Gee Chun saw her lead chopped in half but she still managed to hold a three-stroke advantage entering the final round of the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship in Maryland. Chun shot a three-over 75 after opening with rounds of 64 and 69 at Congressional Country Club. The South Korean sits at eight-under 208 as she pursues her third career major title. Ireland’s Stephanie Meadow is in a tie for 10th after her third round 72 left her two under par overall. Her compatriot Leona Maguire is seven over par after a disappointing 77 on Saturday.

Australia’s Hannah Green (72) is fifth at four-under 212. Chun had three birdies, four bogeys and a harmful double-bogey on the par-5, 16th hole during a shaky overall round. “It was a little tough out there,” Chun said. “I’m so proud of myself because I hang in there after I had double bogey on 16. After I made two pars and then I’m so proud of that, yeah.” Chun entered the round up six shots and was still leading by five before the problems on 16. One of her troublesome shots was an eight-iron that sailed over the green. “I was trying to forget about it when it's done,” Chun said of the hole. Jennifer Kupcho, who won the first major of the season — The Chevron Championship in the spring — is among four golfers tied for sixth at three-under 213. She shot 74 on Saturday. Also tied for sixth are Jennifer Chang (73), Canada’s Brooke Henderson (73) and Thailand’s Atthaya Thitikul (68). US Women’s Open champion Minjee Lee (73) of Australia is tied for 10th with Meadow. World No. 1 Jin Young Ko (71) of South Korea is part of a seven-way tie for 12th place at one under. Nelly Korda (72) is tied for 29th place at one over 217.
