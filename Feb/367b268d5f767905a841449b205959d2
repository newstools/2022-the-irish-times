Former Connacht Rugby lead physiotherapist Garrett Coughlan has joined the Mayo GAA medical team for the 2022 season, a significant addition for the county given Coughlan’s experience across several sports. Originally an elite distance runner, Coughlan adds further experience and knowledge to the backroom medical team, the Dubliner having already worked with some of Ireland’s top athletes, the Ireland under-20 rugby team and the Irish men’s and women’s Sevens teams. Mayo GAA chairman Séamus Tuohy welcomed the news, saying: “Garrett will oversee the physiotherapy requirements for all of our county teams in the coming year. “It is important that we have a consistent and co-ordinated approach to injury prevention and injury treatment and Garrett and his team have the expertise to deliver this service. I want to wish him and all our medical team all the best for the year ahead.” Coughlan has already gained some experience with the Mayo senior football team, being part of the backroom medical team for the opening games Donegal and Monaghan Allianz National Football League games. Commenting on his new role, the Westport-based physiotherapist said: “I have spent a fantastic 11 years with the IRFU and Connacht Rugby and now I hope that my experience will further assist Mayo GAA and the local community.” In 2015 Coughlan was awarded specialist membership of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists (SMISCP) in the area of sports medicine. He has over 30 journal articles published in the areas of athlete profiling, concussion, lower limb rehabilitation and assessment, and also launched a private practice called CORE Health and Performance that will operate from the new High Performance Centre at Hastings Insurance MacHale Park in Castlebar.
