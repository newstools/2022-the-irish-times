Republic of Ireland 1 Philippines 0 Ireland dealt with a brutal Turkish sun and raft of changes at half-time to see off a Philippines side ranked 53rd in the world as preparations for their World Cup qualifier in Georgia on June 27th gain pace. The solitary Irish goal, 10 minutes before half-time, was finished by Lilly Agg after smart build-up play by Heather Payne and Jess Ziu saw Stephanie Roche’s shot well saved by Kiara Fontanilla before Agg followed up. The entire move was warmly received across the YouTube feed by a Philippines coach roaring ‘Awww, f*** off’ as the ball nestled in the back of the net. The stadium announcer quickly awarded the strike to Megan Connolly but Agg, the London City Lionesses midfielder, was clearly on the end of a slick attack. Next, the Ireland squad from their training base in Antalya, Turkey to face a Georgian side they already beat 11-0 last year before the final qualifiers in September — at home to Finland and away to Slovakia, as Vera Pauw’s squad endeavour to secure a play-off for the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand.
