The Premier League has suspended its agreement with its Russian broadcast partner with the unanimous support of its clubs and donated £1 million (€1.2 million) “to support the people of Ukraine”. The decision not to show games in Russia, which relates to a deal with Rambler (Okko Sport), was made at a shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday. It had been expected after the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last Thursday the situation was under review. “The league strongly condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” a statement said. “We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those impacted. The £1 million donation will be made to the Disasters Emergency Committee to deliver humanitarian aid directly to those in need.” The league showed solidarity with Ukraine across the most recent round of matches, including with captains wearing yellow and blue armbands and big screens displaying ‘Football Stands Together’ on the same colours. The UK sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “This is absolutely the right thing to do and we fully support the Premier League’s decision to stop broadcasting matches in Russia in response to Putin’s barbaric, senseless invasion of Ukraine. “Russia cannot be allowed to legitimise its illegal war through sport and culture, and we must work together to ensure Putin remains a pariah on the international stage.” – Guardian
