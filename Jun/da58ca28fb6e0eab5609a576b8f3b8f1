Sir, – According to the Irish Red Cross they have raised in the region of €37 million for Ukrainian refugees. This was due to the extremely generous donations by the people here in Ireland. Yet the majority of refugees arriving into this country are met with appalling conditions including no cooking facilities on arriving into places like Citywest. This is down to a badly managed Irish Government who are failing these people and our own homeless every day. Most of the Ukrainian refugees arriving here are in shock and traumatised and as our Government has offered to welcome them into our country the least they can do is show them some respect and house them properly. Surely the Government could liaise with the Irish Red Cross (custodians of this huge amount of money) and quickly resolve these issues. The money is there for the refugees. Is our Government? – Yours, etc, ANGIE COADY, Glenageary, Co Dublin.
