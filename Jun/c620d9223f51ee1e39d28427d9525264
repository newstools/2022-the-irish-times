Tom Cronin, its managing director, describes it as the biggest little brewhouse you haven’t heard of – Rye River Brewing Company is now the best-selling craft brewery in Ireland, yet many beer drinkers won’t have come across the name before. Based in Celbridge, Co Kildare, the company brews up to 40 different beers each week using 30 unique recipes, working around the clock. The best-selling brand is McGargles. Widely available in off-licences and independents around the country, it has won numerous awards. In addition to this, Rye River is responsible for own-label beers for Lidl (Crafty Brewing Company), Tesco (Solas) and Dunnes Stores (Grafters). “We take great pride in producing these with the same level of care and attention as RRBC beer,” says Cronin. “They’ve received many awards for these brands too.” The company is a member of Bord Bia’s Origin Green programme, and from 2021 has used only electricity generated by renewable sources. The company is seeking to raise finance for the next phase of its development, which will include the Source, an intimate event space in the brewery that will be used for gigs, art exhibitions, comedy and theatre. Recently, it rebranded McGargles to Rye River Brewing Company. The beers remain exactly the same. I tasted my way through the Backwaters American Wheat, the Big Bangin’ IPA and the Dam Buster Double IPA; all three were classic examples of the genre. I suspect the delicious, award-winning Big Bangin’, with its tropical fruits and crisp clean finish, will go down well at parties and barbecues this summer.
