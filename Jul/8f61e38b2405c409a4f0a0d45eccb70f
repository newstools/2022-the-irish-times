This week, two wines reduced to €10 a bottle in O’Briens. The Loire Valley is famous for its Sauvignon Blanc from regions such as Sancerre, Pouilly-Fumé and Touraine. If you enjoy Marlborough Sauvignon, this is well worth trying out. Porta 6 has been one of the most popular wines with O’Briens customers for a number of years. I can understand why. It is one of those crowd-pleasing wines that everyone enjoys and at €10, it offers great value for money. It is also available in a three-litre bag-in-box for €36. Fresh with enticing aromas, this is a racy crisp white wine with citrus zest and succulent pear and apple fruits. This would go nicely with summery salads, creamy goat’s cheese, or grilled sea bass. This is one of the great all-purpose wines, light enough to drink solo at parties or before dinner, but rich enough to match with all sorts of white and red meats, as well as baked Mediterranean vegetable dishes. Soft ripe supple dark fruits with a rounded, easy finish.
