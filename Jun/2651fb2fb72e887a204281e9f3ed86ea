Sir, – In the same way as your correspondent (Letters, June 8th), we also signed up to provide spare rooms for refugees but apart from two texts since to confirm our continued availability, we have heard nothing to progress the matter. We also have provided accommodation privately and it seems this will exclude us from the support system although that wasn’t our motivation in the first place. We simply wanted to help someone with a greater need than ours. Surely tapping into the genuine hospitality of those who offered up their homes as safe refuge for these brave people and supporting those who participate is the only way of looking after our much troubled Ukrainian guests. – Yours, etc, WILLIE BURKE, Cork.
