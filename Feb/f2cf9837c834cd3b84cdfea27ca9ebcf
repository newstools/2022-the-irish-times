Ireland internationals Craig Casey and Gavin Coombes have returned to the Munster setup and will be available for the United Rugby Championship match against Dragons on Saturday. Scrumhalf Casey featured from the bench against Italy but with no Six Nations fixture this weekend, the pair have been released from Ireland camp. With Casey and Conor Murray involved in the Ireland setup, and Rowan Osborne injured, the province have signed Shannon’s Aran Hehir as short-term cover at scrumhalf. Munster said in a statement that Hehir is an Ireland Clubs international who had previously lined out for the Munster under-18 Clubs team. Prop Roman Salanoa remains unavailable but the province said his ankle injury does not require surgery. Damian de Allende has stepped up his recovery but Saturday’s match will come too soon while Matt Gallagher is a doubt with a calf strain. RG Snyman (knee), Jason Jenkins (abdomen), Liam O’Connor (knee), Thomas Ahern (thigh), Keith Earls (thigh), Jack Daly (ankle) are all out.
