National broadcaster RTÉ has secured the rights for all six of Ireland’s Uefa Nations League games in 2022. The campaign begins away against Armenia on Saturday, June 4th and then Stephen Kenny’s men will host Ukraine in the Aviva Stadium on Wednesday, June 8th as Irish fans get an opportunity to show their solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Scotland are up next on Saturday, June 11th in the Aviva followed by the away game against Ukraine, which will provisionally take place in Lódz, Poland on Tuesday, June 14th. Finally, in September, Ireland will travel to take on Scotland and finish the campaign at home against Armenia. The games will be live on RTÉ2, RTÉ Player and RTÉ Radio RTÉ Group Head of Sport, Declan McBennett, said “RTÉ Sport is delighted to bring the Uefa Nations League games to the audience free to air given the growing momentum behind the men’s international team and the significance of the games with Scotland, Armenia and, in particular, Ukraine. “Combined with our coverage of the women’s national team, the under 21’s qualification campaign and the domestic game it visibly demonstrates our commitment to keeping key sporting moments available to the widest possible audience.”
