American pair Billy Horschel and Talor Gooch will share a one-shot lead going into Sunday’s final day of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Horschel followed up his second-round 71 with another one-under-par total after four birdies and three bogeys at Bay Hill on Saturday. Gooch hit four birdies and as many bogeys in a level-par 72, after scores of 69 and 68 in his first two rounds. Norway’s Viktor Hovland, who began the third round as outright leader after a six-under 66 on Friday, followed up with a three-over 75 and sits a shot off the pace. Rory McIlroy, who led the field after the opening day with a seven-under round of 65, dropped two places and is tied in sixth after a four-over par 76. Northern Ireland’s McIlroy double-bogeyed the 15th and dropped shots at five other holes, while he made birdies at the 12th, 13th and 16th as he ended the day four shots off the lead. Fellow countryman Graeme McDowell is also tied for sixth after climbing 24 places on the leaderboard thanks to a three-under round of 69. England’s Matt Fitzpatrick moved into contention, five shots behind the leaders and tied for ninth, after shooting a two-under-par 70. Tyrell Hatton dropped 10 places and is now in joint-12th place after following rounds of 69 and 68 with a six-over 78, which included seven bogeys and a solitary birdie at the fourth hole. Meanwhile over in Singapore, world number one Ko Jin-young hit five birdies in the last six holes to beat Lee Jeong-eun and overnight leader Chun In-gee at the final hole and win the HSBC Women’s World Championship title at Sentosa Golf Club on Sunday. Leona Maguire finished in a tie for 13th after a final round 68, her best effort of the week. She carded five birdies and one bogey to pick up four strokes across the round. A birdie at the 18th gave Ko the title for the first time by two shots as former US Open winner Lee, joint leader going down the last, imploded around the final green. Ko rolled in her third shot at the par-four from 12 feet to move to 17-under par while Lee’s double-bogey left her three shots behind the winner with Chun taking joint-second alongside Lee Min-jee. “I played well today, but it’s tough to go round playing with two amazing Korean players. We’re close friends,” said Ko, who has won six of the last 10 LPGA events. “I had a lot more confidence on the back nine than on the front nine, so I got a lot of birdies on the back nine.” Overnight leader Chun claimed a birdie at the second to extend her early advantage, but she was soon left trailing as those around her picked up the pace. However, she pulled to within a shot of the leaders with a birdie at the 13th and another at the 16th left her a shot behind the leaders. Thailand’s Atthaya Thitikul put herself in contention with five birdies in the opening seven holes before a bogey at the penultimate hole wrecked her chances of the title, with the teenager eventually finishing in a tie for fourth on 14-under. Ko, meanwhile, had birdied the eighth and ninth to stay in the hunt, but a dropped shot at the 12th looked to have halted her progress. But birdies at the 13th and 14th holes were followed by another at the par-three 15th when she sent her tee shot through the green, only to roll her putt from well off the edge in for a birdie from 25 feet. That hauled the 26-year-old back into contention and an eight-foot putt at the 16th gave Ko a fourth consecutive birdie to move into a share of the lead. With the pressure mounting, Lee Jeong-eun endured a horrendous time around the final green, over-hitting a bunker shot off the other side of the putting surface and taking another three strokes to hole out. That left Ko to roll in yet another birdie putt to win by two strokes.
