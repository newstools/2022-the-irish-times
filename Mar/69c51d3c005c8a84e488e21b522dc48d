Laois 0-14 Limerick 0-15 Limerick are back in the promotion hunt in Division Three following a hard-earned win over Laois in O’Moore Park. Two late points from sub Robbie Bourke helped Billy Lee’s side get the better of the home side as they eventually pulled through after a second half that ebbed and flowed in both directions. The result means that Laois’ slim promotion hopes have been ended and they must instead beat Longford next Sunday to avoid relegation. With Adrian Enright to the fore with four points and Josh Ryan and Peter Nash also impressive, Limerick led 0-10 to 0-6 at the break after a dominant second quarter that saw them hit five points on the trot. But Laois were impressive after half-time and they duly hit five in row to go one clear by the 52nd minute when veteran sub Mark Timmons put them ahead. The game swung both ways from there to the finish with a couple of Mark Barry efforts cancelled out by Bourke and Darragh Treacy. Laois regained the lead with four minutes remaining when Kieran Lillis pointed from distance, but Limerick got the last two scores – both from Bourke – to go top of the table, until Sunday at least. Laois are looking the other direction and must beat Longford next Sunday to be safe.
