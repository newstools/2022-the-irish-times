Twenty-seven deaths linked to Covid-19 have been recorded in Northern Ireland in the latest weekly update. The weekly toll is down 11 on the 38 deaths that occurred in the previous week, according to data compiled by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). The latest deaths, registered in the week ending March 4th, take the total number of coronavirus-linked fatalities recorded by Nisra to 4,347. The Nisra figure is drawn from different data sources and is always higher than the Department of Health’s total, as it provides a broader picture of the impact of Covid-19. On March 4th, the department had reported 3,228 deaths. The department’s statistics focus primarily on hospital deaths and only include people who have tested positive for the virus. Nisra obtains its data from death certificates on which Covid-19 is recorded as a factor by a medical professional, regardless of where the death took place or whether the patient tested positive. The statistics agency reports its Covid data with a lag of a week. The Nisra figure includes 3,021 deaths in hospital, 937 in care homes, and 389 at residential addresses, hospices or other locations. Nisra reported that up to March 4th, the deaths of 1,229 care home residents were linked to Covid-19, 28.3 per cent of all coronavirus-related deaths. Covid-19 was also mentioned on the death certificate of 34 of the 338 deaths registered in the week to March 4th. Some of the deaths registered during the period could have taken place before that week, as fatalities can take a number of days to register. Those aged 75 and over account for 73.4 per cent of the Covid-related deaths registered between March 19th, 2020 and March 4th, 2022.
