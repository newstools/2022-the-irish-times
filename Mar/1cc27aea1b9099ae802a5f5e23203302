The UK government has amended the general licence granted to Chelsea by announcing the club will now be allowed to sell tickets to away games and cup matches. The Blues were banned from selling tickets after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned for his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. But the UK government has now put in place special dispensation for away fans, cup games and women’s fixtures provided Chelsea do not receive any revenue. UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston said: “The government has today made alterations to the licence to Chelsea Football club so that fans will be able to access tickets to away matches, cup games and women’s fixtures. “I would like to thank fans for their patience while we have engaged with the football authorities to make this possible. “Since Roman Abramovich was added to the UK’s sanctions list for his links to Vladimir Putin we have worked extensively to ensure the club can continue to play football while ensuring the sanctions regime continues to be enforced.” The amendment means Chelsea fans will be able to purchase tickets to future Premier League away fixtures, with revenue going to the home club. Visiting fans will also be able to buy tickets for Chelsea’s remaining Premier League home fixtures, with the money going to the Premier League. For future FA Cup and Champions League matches, fans will be able to purchase tickets with revenue collected by the relevant competition organiser or home club. No further home tickets will be made available to fans at Chelsea’s remaining Premier League home fixtures, but season-ticket holders and holders of tickets purchased before the sanctions were imposed will still be able to attend. The government has made an exception for Women’s Super League fixtures to allow fans to purchase home as well as away tickets, due to the risk of the matches being played in front of empty stands.
