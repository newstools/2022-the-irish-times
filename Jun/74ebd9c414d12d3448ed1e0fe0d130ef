Two housing reports delivered two different takes on the Irish property market in the past week. MyHome.ie, which is owned by The Irish Times, suggests that house price growth is slowing in the face of cost-of-living concerns and rising interest rates. However Daft.ie says they’re accelerating, fast approaching the Celtic Tiger peak, amid chronically low levels of supply. So, what’s really going on? In the latest episode of the Inside Business podcast, Irish Times Economics Correspondent Eoin Burke-Kennedy sheds some light on the differences in the two reports, while Marian Finnegan of Sherry Fitzgerald has the estate agents view. Plus: the European Central Bank is expecting to hike its interest rates from next month, with further increases anticipated as the year rolls on. Cliff Taylor explains what effect those hikes might have on house buying over the next 12 months.
