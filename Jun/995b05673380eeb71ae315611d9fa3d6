Sir, – Given that pay talks broke down last week with unions refusing a 5 per cent pay increase over two years, they won’t be in any better humour with the latest news that “Top earning public servants to get pay rises of up to 15 per cent” (News, June 22nd). An unfortunate timing of events! – Yours, etc, TADHG McCARTHY, Bray, Co Wicklow. Sir, – The pay restoration to top civil servants brings the words “them” and “us” to mind. – Yours, etc, TOM GILSENAN, Beaumont, Dublin 9. Sir, – Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, about pay restoration for top civil servants, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said, “There never is a good time to do these things.” Perhaps he knows very well when it comes to supporting hard-pressed workers, families and those hit by the cost-of-living increases, they can jolly well wait, because now is certainly not a good time. – Yours, etc, AIDAN RODDY, Cabinteely, Dublin 18.
