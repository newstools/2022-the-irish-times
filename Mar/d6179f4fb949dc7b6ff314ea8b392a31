Two wines from Aldi this week. The Clare Valley in South Australia is better known for producing very fine crisp Riesling, but some of the warmer vineyards are planted with Shiraz, which can be very good. We don’t see enough Greek wine in this country, so I was delighted to come across this wine in Aldi. Assyrtiko is a native Greek variety, most often found on the island of Santorini, where it produces excellent wines. This wine, from the mainland, offer good value for money. Specially Selected Kooliburra Limited Edition Shiraz 2018, Clare Valley, Australia, €9.99 Showing some soft maturity, this is a full-bodied Shiraz (14.5 per cent) with plenty of toasted nuts and vanilla, alongside some ripe blackcurrant and dark cherry fruits. Drink it with a roast of beef or lamb, or barbecued red meats. Assyrtiko 2020, Filos Estate, Florina, Greece, €9.99 This has lovely rich fruits, orange peel, peaches and pears balanced nicely by some citrus acidity. Light to medium-bodied, with a dry finish. Go local and drink it with a Greek salad, calamari or a chicken in a lemony avgolemono sauce.
