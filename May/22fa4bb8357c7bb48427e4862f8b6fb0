From €700 Garmin has unveiled a new watch that is aimed at those who prefer life on the water. The Quatix 7 has new boating features, including multifunction display (MFD) control, anchor drag alarms and tide alerts alongside the traditional autopilot control that brings important information, including water depth, engine RPM, wind and customised data, directly to your wrist. The range now includes a touchscreen, with the Sapphire edition getting an AMOLED display, making it perfect for everyday use too. You also get the usual health and fitness tracking features you’d expect from Garmin devices, such as Pulse OX, stress tracking and multisport monitoring for activities like cycling and golfing. garmin.com
