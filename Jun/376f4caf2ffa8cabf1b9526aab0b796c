Ryanair’s Portuguese cabin staff will go on strike for three days in late June, Portugal’s union of civil aviation personnel, SNPVAC, said on Tuesday. The workers, demanding compliance with Portuguese law and better working conditions, will walk out on June 24th, 25th and 26th, SNPVAC said in a statement. “This mobilisation is not only an opportunity to put the spotlight on multiple attacks on workers’ dignity and to make this reality known but also a moment to show unity and solidarity against dumping”, the union said. Ryanair said that SNPVAC represents fewer than 3 per cent of its cabin crew staff in Portugal. “Ryanair has negotiated collective agreements covering 90 per cent of our people across Europe,” the airline said in a statement. “In recent months we have been negotiating improvements to those agreements as we work through the Covid recovery phase. Those negotiations are going well and we do not expect widespread disruption this summer.” The announcement came a day after Ryanair's Spanish cabin announced a six-day strike planned for late June and early July. French cabin crew at Ryanair went on strike on Sunday and Monday demanding better pay and working conditions, a union representative said earlier, adding that more than 40 flights had to be cancelled. — Reuters
