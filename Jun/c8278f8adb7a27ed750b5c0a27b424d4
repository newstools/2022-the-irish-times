The Green Party felt unwell after attending a press conference on Monday morning, and tested positive on an antigen test. He will attend Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting remotely, and will isolate for seven days. It is the second time the Dublin Bay South TD has tested positive for the virus. He previously contracted Covid in December 2021. He also had a false positive test in November last year in advance of his appearance at COP26, a major climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. There were 453 people in hospital with the Covid-19 on Monday, up 56 when compared to Sunday. Of those in hospital with the virus, 22 were being treated in intensive care units, a decrease of two in the last 24 hours.
