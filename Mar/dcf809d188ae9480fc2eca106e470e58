About 300,000 property owners are to be contacted over the coming weeks to remind them of their requirement to submit a Local Property Tax (LPT) return for the 2022-2025 valuation period, Revenue has confirmed. Property owners were due to submit their LPT return to Revenue in November. To date, LPT returns in respect of 1.7 million properties have been submitted. However, for a further 300,000 properties, an LPT return is overdue. This includes about 160,000 properties for which LPT payment arrangements are in place. Katie Clair, head of Revenue’s LPT branch, said property owners must engage with the process. “All residential property owners were required to submit an LPT return to Revenue last November,” she said. “A key part of the return is selecting the LPT valuation band that applies to the market value of the property at November 1st, 2021. “We are writing to property owners who haven’t yet submitted their LPT return as a reminder that it is a legal requirement to do so. “Regardless of whether you have paid in full or have a rollover payment arrangement in place or even where you agree with the notice of estimate that Revenue has made for your property, you still need to file an LPT return to confirm the correct valuation band of your property. “Such property owners now need to make sure that they engage with Revenue and submit their LPT return.” She added that assistance is available for anyone who may need it. “I urge all property owners who haven’t filed their LPT return to take immediate action and use this opportunity to ensure they are fully compliant with their LPT obligations,” she said. “The easiest way to file your LPT return is online. You access the LPT online portal on revenue.ie. However, if property owners need assistance in completing their LPT return or have any queries regarding their LPT obligations, they can contact the LPT Helpline at 01 738 36 26.”
