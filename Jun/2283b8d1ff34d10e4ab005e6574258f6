Sir, – Every time the Government makes a statement or issues a press release about the Enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Scheme, it persists on emphasising the cost to the taxpayer which is presently estimated to be €2.7 billion. The Government does this as part of its attempts to divide public opinion and convince those in the unaffected counties that the Government is being more than generous. Unfortunately, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and other Ministers fail to realise that every time they mention the cost to the taxpayer, they are exposing the gross incompetence of our own government as exemplified by its complete failure to regulate the quarries and enforce building standards The next time your readers hear a figure for the cost of the revised scheme, I urge them to reflect that it was our government that caused this loss to the taxpayer and not the innocent homeowners unfortunate enough to live in the affected counties. – Yours, etc, JAMES BEARD, Buncrana, Co. Donegal.
