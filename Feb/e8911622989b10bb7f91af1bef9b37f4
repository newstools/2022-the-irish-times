Republic of Ireland 1 Wales 0 The Republic of Ireland finished third at the Pinatar Cup in La Manga, Spain after this competent victory over a poor Welsh outfit. Denise O’Sullivan’s 17th international goal was created by the Cork No 10’s rapid thinking to pick off a sloppy clearance before unleashing a right-foot shot into the top corner. Besides Kyra Carusa’s early miss, having rounded the Welsh goalkeeper Olivia Clarke she shot wide, Ireland showed a worrying trait of sitting back and inviting the opposition onto them. Not that Wales ever looked capable of equalising as Irish manager Vera Pauw continued to use this tournament to blood talent like Abbie Larkin, with the 16-year-old introduced for Carusa at half-time. Ireland’s next match is the World Cup qualifier away to Sweden on April 12th. IRELAND: Brosnan (Everton); Fahey (Liverpool), Louise Quinn (Birmingham City), McCarthy (Galway WFC); Ziu (Shelbourne), O’Sullivan (NC Courage), Littlejohn (Aston Villa), McCabe (Arsenal); Lucy Quinn (Birmingham City), Carusa (HB Koge), Payne (FS Seminoles). Subs: Larkin (Shelbourne) for Carusa (half-time), Badana (DLR Waves) for Brosnan, Kiernan (Liverpool) for Payne (both 63), Barrett (FC Koln) for Lucy Quinn (85).
