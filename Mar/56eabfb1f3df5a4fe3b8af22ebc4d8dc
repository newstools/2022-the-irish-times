The price of consumer staples like bread is set to be driven up by the war in Ukraine, the Cabinet has been warned. Ministers were told on Tuesday morning that the cost of these products, along with rising energy prices, is the most pressing issue facing consumers arising from the crisis caused by the Russian invasion. Cabinet was also told that there will be a meeting with builders on accommodation for refugees, while the Department of Housing is talking to local authorities about what else they can do, and the Office of Public Works and the HSE are looking at State-owned sites. Citywest, Millstreet Arena, the National Show Centre and land at Gormanstown owned by the Defence Forces are also being considered for use. The Cabinet meeting was chaired via Zoom by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is isolating in Washington DC following his positive Covid-19 test last week. Earlier, Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said Ireland could take in as many as 200,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukranie, Mr McConalogue said that Ireland has no option but to “reach out to those of our fellow European citizens who are displaced who have nowhere else to go.” “We have to do our best”, said Mr McConalogue acknowledging to RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that the task would be challenging.
