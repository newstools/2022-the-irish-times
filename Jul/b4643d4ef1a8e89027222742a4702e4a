Kevin Doherty is having a week. Before the local derby, to somehow cut a 19-point gap between themselves and Dundalk, the Drogs manager is embroiled in the Uefa Pro Licence course (a number of future footballing professors, including Jim McGuinness, flocked into Tallaght stadium to watch the Champions League tie on Tuesday night). None of this concerns Stephen O’Donnell’s Dundalk, the only squad capable of keeping the title race afloat with four months remaining in the season, as tonight represents one of two games in hand that could reduce Shamrock Rovers’ lead at the top to four points. Three defeats beyond from a four-game winning streak, Damien Duff’s charges must halt a steep decline before it plunges them into the relegation mire. Stranger things have happened but in all likelihood Harps and UCD will remain the Premier Division’s whipping boys as Shel’s inconsistent campaign cements them just below mid-table.
