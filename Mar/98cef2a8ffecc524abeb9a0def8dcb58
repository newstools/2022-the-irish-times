Jürgen Klopp believes that talk of Liverpool winning the quadruple is crazy, with the manager citing how even Manchester City have not been able to achieve it. Klopp’s team beat Chelsea 11-10 on penalties at Wembley on Sunday to claim the League Cup. With Liverpool six points behind City in the league and still in the FA Cup – Norwich are their visitors for Wednesday’s fifth-round tie – and Champions League, the manager was asked about Liverpool achieving an unprecedented clean sweep of trophies. “No team in the history of English football ever won the quadruple, right? Because it’s really difficult,” Klopp said. “We are not even close to thinking about crazy stuff like that. We have won the Carabao Cup, we are behind City in the league and now we have Norwich in the FA Cup after 120 minutes on Sunday. Even Manchester City with all their quality did not win it. The reality is [that] to win something you have to be focused on the next step and the one after that – that’s what we do. “I don’t see it as a compliment [if people think they can] but it’s better people think we can do good things rather than be useless. I don’t need this kind of compliment – we are close to nothing at the moment. We face a lot of good teams between now and the end of May. The smallest problem I have right now is thinking they [players] could fly.” Klopp said Thiago Alcântara, who was forced out of the final with a hamstring problem, could be available against West Ham on Saturday or Internazionale next Tuesday. – Guardian
