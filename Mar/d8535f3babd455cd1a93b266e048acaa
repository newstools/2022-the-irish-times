Irish drug maker Amryt Pharma’s operations lost $71.2 million (€65 million) last year, new accounts show. The company, which specialises in treatments for rare diseases, said on Wednesday that it planned to return $30 million to investors through a share buy-back scheme. Amryt reported that revenues rose 22 per cent to $222.5 million last year from $186.5 million in 2020. Its operations lost $71.2 million in 2021, against $46.5 million the previous year. Amryt last year bought US business Chiasma for $330 million. The company makes Mycapssa, which treats a condition that causes gigantism in sufferers. Before accounting for the Chiasma deal’s costs, Amryt’s operations generated $29.8 million cash. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was $42 million last year. Biggest seller Amryt’s biggest selling drug, Metreleptin, used to treat a condition that causes sufferers problems with the way their body stores fat, generated $141.2 million in revenues last year. Lomitapide, which reduces high cholesterol levels caused by a genetic disorder, turned over $74.75 million in 2021. Mycapssa generated $6.4 million. Amryt this week announced that it was carrying out a phase three study to determine if the drug could be used to treat some types of cancer. If regulators approve Mycapssa for this, it would open a global market worth $1.9 billion. Amryt had $113 million in cash on December 31st. Chief executive, Joe Wiley, said the board approved plans to return $30 million to shareholders through share buy backs. “Today we are issuing revenue guidance for full-year 2022 of $260 million to $270 million which represents growth of 17 per cent to 21 per cent on 2021,” said Mr Wiley.
