Sir, – Echoing your correspondent (Letters, June 8th) I have to ask has the GAA at HQ lost the plot? Asking travelling fans to travel unreasonable distances for the All-Ireland Football qualifiers. Do they not notice that diesel and petrol prices have rocketed recently. They have also decided to wrap up the hurling and football championships before the end of July, leaving the rest of the summer and autumn open uncontested to other competing sports. - Yours, etc. JAMES DUNNE, Dublin 16.
