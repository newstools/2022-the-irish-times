Agent Coonan Property is guiding a price of €6 million for a strategically positioned land bank on the outskirts of Naas town centre in Co Kildare. The Knocks, as it is known, comprises 57 acres (23.07 hectares) of land, which the agent says offers an opportunity to develop a “sustainable urban district and decarbonised zone” near the town. As the key measures of the Naas/Sallins Transport Strategy 2020 are implemented, the site will facilitate a priority bus route to Sallins from Naas town centre. The lands have two objectives listed in the Naas Local Area Plan 2021-2027. About 43.84 acres (17.74 hectares) have been designated as “Strategic Reserve”, and are slated for future development in line with the expansion of Naas town. A further 13.2 acres (5.34 hectares) are to be used as open space and amenity. This will happen once a masterplan is integrated into the Local Area Plan in the future. Thriving town Naas is a thriving town that continues to grow across its residential, business and leisure sectors. The town is well served by an extensive range of shops, cafes, restaurants, pubs, hotels, and medical facilities. There are several schools in the area and the town is serviced by regular and reliable bus routes. Nearby Sallins provides a park-and-ride rail service to Heuston station in Dublin, while the M7 motorway is only minutes away from the site, providing easy onward access. Will Coonan of Coonan Property says: “Land sales have been thriving in recent times and prime land banks such as this one won’t gather any dust. This land has good road frontage along the Grand Canal and Greenway and its divisions are neighboured by Millennium Park, home to the Kerry Group and also one of the country’s leading business parks.”
