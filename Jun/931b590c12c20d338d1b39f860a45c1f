Erling Haaland’s transfer to Manchester City has been confirmed by the Premier League champions, with the striker describing it as “a proud day for me and my family” and saying he has joined the perfect club. Haaland’s father, Alfie, played for City in the early 2000s and the 21-year-old has joined from Borussia Dortmund after his €60m buyout clause was met. He will earn £375,000 a week, plus bonuses. “I have always watched City and have loved doing so in recent seasons,” Haaland said after signing a contract to 2027. “You can’t help but admire their style of play, it’s exciting and they create a lot of chances, which is perfect for a player like me. “There are so many world-class players in this squad and Pep [Guardiola] is one of the greatest managers of all-time, so I believe I am in the right place to fulfil my ambitions. I want to score goals, win trophies and improve as a footballer and I am confident I can do that here.” Haaland scored 86 goals in 89 games for Dortmund, after joining from Red Bull Salzburg. Two goals for Norway against Sweden in the Nations League on Sunday took his tally to 20 from 21 caps. City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, said: “Erling has everything we want in a striker, and we are certain he will excel in this squad and this system. His rise has been remarkable, but he is still only 21. His best years are ahead of him, and we are confident he can get even better working with Pep.” - Guardian
