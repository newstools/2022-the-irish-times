Sir, – Now that inflation has taken off again, the Government might consider indexing asset values for inflation for capital gain purposes. This used to be the case, but was stopped in 2003 when inflation was very low. Now would be a good time to restart the practice as otherwise you have a stealth capital tax that eats the non gains due to inflation as well as any real gains. – Yours, etc, JAMES MAHON, Glasnevin, Dublin 11. Sir, – When Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe says there are limits to what the State can do in relation to the cost-of-living crisis, I feel what he actually means is that there is a limit to what he is willing to do in Government to address this. – Yours, etc, COLM DOYLE, Blackhall Street, Dublin 7.
