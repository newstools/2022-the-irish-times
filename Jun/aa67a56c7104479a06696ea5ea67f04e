1 Wash and dry two 500ml jars and their lids. Set aside. 2 Peel the carrots into thin strips and place in a large bowl. Peel the cucumber into strips and discard (or eat) the seeded centre. Thinly slice the radishes, chillies and onion. Mix everything well in the bowl. 3 Divide carrots, radishes, cucumbers, onion and jalapeños evenly into the two clean jars. 4 Combine water, vinegars, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until sugar is dissolved, about three minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool for two minutes. Pour mixture over the vegetables in the jars and allow it to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. 5 Screw on the lids and refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.
