The combination of current and expected future demand for housing in Dublin’s commuter belt counties should see strong interest from investors and developers in the sale of a 12-acre land holding in Mullingar, Co Westmeath. The lands, on the Dublin Road and just 700m from Mullingar town centre, are being offered to the market by joint agents Bannon and James L Murtagh & Sons on behalf of St Finian’s Diocesan Trust at a guide price of €2.75 million. The subject holding surrounds the diocesan office, which the trust is retaining for its continued use, and is distributed across two parcels of land extending to a combined area of about 4.85 hectares (12 acres). The entire holding is zoned “Proposed Residential” in the Mullingar Local Area Plan 2014–2020 (as extended). An architectural feasibility study prepared by Altu Architects indicates potential (subject to planning consent) for the development of a housing scheme of about 116 units, comprising 27 two-bedroom houses, 35 three-bedroom houses and 54 four-bedroom houses. While the lands have a sylvan setting adjoining St Paul’s Catholic Church, St Colman’s National School and Clonard House, they are near all the amenities of Mullingar. Mullingar is a well-established commuter town and sits about 80km or a one-hour drive from Dublin via the N4 and M4 motorway. The town is also served by mainline rail services. Niall Brereton of Bannon says: “This is a rare opportunity to acquire a development site in one of the most desirable residential locations within the Dublin commuter belt. Mullingar is a highly accessible town given its proximity to the N4 as well as Mullingar train station offering daily services to and from Dublin city centre. The subject land has terrific development potential, subject to planning permission, and will appeal to developers seeking opportunities to deliver new housing units in an area of high demand.”
