Ireland look all but set to play host to Euro 2028 alongside the UK after rival bids from Turkey and Russia fell by the wayside, according to reports in the Daily Mail. It is understood that Turkey are likely to withdraw their candicacy in the wake of two failed bids to host Euro 2016 and 2024, while any bid from Russia is certain to fail due to that country’s actions in invading Ukraine. Reports suggest that Uefa are receptive to an unopposed bidding process given the uncertainty the war in Ukraine is causing for European football. If there was to be a contest, the bidding process would have lasted until September 2023 but Uefa is now likely to confirm the hosts sooner if one bid is in fact received. This would be depending on the UK and Ireland meeting technical requirements, which is expected to be a simple formality. The FAI alongisde unions from Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England announced their desire to bid only last month.
