Stephen Kenny’s Ireland team go in search of back-to-back Nations League wins as they take on Ukraine in Łódź, Poland tonight. Both sides are without some key players, as the Ukraine squad are recovering from a bug while Ireland will miss the injured Michael Obafemi, as well as being without Seamus Coleman, John Egan and Shane Duffy. In action this afternoon the Irish Under-21 team take on Italy, with a playoff spot for the Europeans Championships already secured, but knowing a victory would mean automatic qualification. Monday’s All-Ireland football quarter-final draw renewed some old acquaintances – Kerry and Mayo is the pick of the fixtures, Dublin take on Cork, Galway face Armagh and Derry will be favourites against Clare. In his column this morning (Subscriber Only), Kevin McStay explains why Armagh are the shark in the water: “They have a bracing, engaged defence and, most importantly, they have some fine footballers. They are the shark in the water even as the beaches fill up.” In his weekly column Gerry Thornley is predicting that Ciaran Frawley and Joe McCarthy will be involved in Ireland’s 40-man squad for the tour to New Zealand, due to be announced today. Check out his predicted squad here. Owen Doyle explains why referee Mike Adamson’s performance review from the Stormers’ win over Ulster, could be uncomfortable: “Adamson’s performance will be studied by both teams. Issues abounded, particularly at the breakdown. Leading up to the vital score, the Stormers appeared to fly off their feet and go beyond the ball, ensuring possession was protected.” Meanwhile, Philip Reid explains that LIV Golf’s next focus is on if their players will be entitled to earn world ranking points, which is so often the ranking used to earn exemptions into the four Majors (The Masters, the US PGA, the US Open and the British Open).
