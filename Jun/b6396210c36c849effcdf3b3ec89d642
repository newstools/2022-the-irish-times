Dessie Farrell has not named Con O’Callaghan or James McCarthy in his starting side to take on Cork in this evening’s All-Ireland quarter-final against Cork at Croke Park. The full panel of 26 has not yet been announced but RTÉ sport have reported that the pair will miss out due to hamstring injuries. The duo alongside Lorcan O’Dell are the three changes made to the starting side that powered past Kildare last time out in the Leinster final. Jonny Cooper, Paddy Small and Niall Scully are the three who come into the lineup. Cork for their part have named an unchanged XV from the one that worked its way past Limerick in the qualifiers to get to this stage. Dublin: Evan Comerford; Eoin Murchan, Michael Fitzsimons, Lee Gannon; John Small, Jonny Cooper, Seán Bugler; Brian Fenton, Tom Lahiff; Niall Scully, Brian Howard, Ciarán Kilkenny; Cormac Costello, Dean Rock, Paddy Small. Cork: Micheál Aodh Martin; Sean Powter, Maurice Shanley, Kevin O’Donovan; John Cooper, Rory Maguire, Mattie Taylor; Ian Maguire, Colm O’Callaghan; Daniel Dineen, Eoghan McSweeney, John O’Rourke; Steven Sherlock, Brian Hurley, Cathail O’Mahony.
