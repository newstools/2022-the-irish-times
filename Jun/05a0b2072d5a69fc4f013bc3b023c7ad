Sir, – Catherine Flynn (“At ease with Ulysses: Daunted by this notoriously difficult novel?”, Books, June 16th) describes a “good way in” to reading Ulysses, with 18 essays, maps, annotations, and other helpful materials from leading Joyce scholars. If one is determined to spend their entire summer reading the same book, then by all means this seems to be the best way forward. However, I can offer an alternative option for most readers: read a few books that you might actually enjoy instead! – Yours, etc, Dr MARIA O’BRIEN, Bayside, Dublin 13. Sir, – June Rodgers writes (Letters, June 16th) that John McCourt (Letters, June 11th) could have easily solved the problem of obtaining James Joyce’s Ulysses in the early 1960s by taking the train to Belfast. My experience of obtaining the book was much simpler; I went to my local library in Dublin where I was at first refused as I had not reached the magical age of 21. Two months later I proudly presented my passport and the librarian, having retrieved the book from the dungeons, handed it over. – Is mise, DENIS RYAN, Ballymoney, Co Wexford.
