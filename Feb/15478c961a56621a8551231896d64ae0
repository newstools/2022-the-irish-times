There are 75,000 people currently waiting for inpatient and day-case prodecures in Irish hospitals. But a €350 billion investment in hospital waiting lists will reduce them to their lowest level in five years, according to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The Minister on Friday launched the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, reports our Health Editor Paul Cullen, which is billed to be the first of a “multi-annual” reform programme to “stabilise and reduce” waiting lists and times in the Irish health service.
