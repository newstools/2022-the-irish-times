Overseas arrivals to the Republic neared pre-Covid levels last month, according to official figures published on Wednesday. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) calculates that 1.59 million passengers arrived in the Republic on “overseas routes” in May. State statisticians say this is 19 times more than the 85,400 people who travelled here during the same month last year, when Government continued to ban most travel. However, it was just 12 per cent less than the 1.82 million passengers who arrived in the Republic in May 2019, the year before the pandemic struck and the period the travel industry regards as a real benchmark. The figures show that 1.58 million left the State for overseas destinations last month, a multiple of the 97,000 who departed the Republic in May 20202. That figure trailed the 2019 departures total of 1.85 million by around 15 per cent. Flying accounts for the vast majority of people travelling in or out of the State. The CSO figures show that 1.5 million arrived and left this way. Sea accounted for 90,500 arrivals and close to 80,000 departures last month. Gregg Patrick, statistician, said the figures show air travel’s recovery was most dramatic. “Among the continental routes, Spanish routes were the busiest, with 220,200 passengers arriving on these routes, a more than 32-fold increase compared to May 2021,” he noted. Britain accounted for the most travellers to the Republic in May, with 536,200 people arriving by air and sea, against just 32,400 during the same month last year.
