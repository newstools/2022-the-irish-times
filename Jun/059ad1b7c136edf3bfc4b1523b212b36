Jim Crawford’s Republic of Ireland Under-21s have secured, at the very least, a play-off spot to qualify for next year’s European Championships in Romania and Georgia. Ireland have never qualified for a major tournament at this age grade but Italy’s draw with Sweden in Helsingborg means they have secured second spot in Group F. Victory in Ascoli next Tuesday (kick off 4.30pm) would see Crawford’s ever improving squad finish as group winners. The young Azzurri won 2-0 at Tallaght stadium last November and remain undefeated after nine matches. Ireland also lost away to Montenegro but avenged that loss with a Will Smallbone inspired 3-1 result last Monday.
