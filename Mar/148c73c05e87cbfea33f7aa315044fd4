A video for St Patrick’s Day has been released by the Department of Foreign Affairs to mark “Ireland’s solidarity with Ukraine”. The special “St Patrick’s Day video greeting from Ireland to the world” is set to the sound of Paul Brady’s 1966 The Island, a song about the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The video moves from scenes of Irish independence, to EU membership and humanitarian work to videos from the Russian war in Ukraine and protests in Ireland. It ends with an image of Government Buildings in Dublin lit up in blue and yellow with the words: “On this St Patrick’s Day, Ireland stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and people everywhere in crisis. We are thinking of you today.” “The Taoiseach has encouraged Ireland’s network of missions , that would usually light up green, to light up in blue and yellow, the colours of the flag of Ukraine, and has invited partners who normally take part in the ‘global greening’ to join us in doing so,” the department said in a statement. Ireland is to mark St Patrick’s Day “ in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, acknowledging their resilience and courage and assuring them of our unwavering support, as we express our Irish identity including our strong commitment to democratic and humanitarian values,” the department said. “In addition to expressing Ireland’s support for the people of Ukraine, a core message of this year’s St Patrick’s Day is that Ireland is reopening. Our international programme is focused on the theme of rebuilding connections and supporting our communities across the globe, acknowledging the importance of Ireland’s global diaspora.” Watch video here
