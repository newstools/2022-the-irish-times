Seattle-based Remitly Global, a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families, has announced plans to add 120 roles to its operation in Cork over the next six months. The new jobs are supported by IDA Ireland. Established in 2011 and listed on the Nasdaq stock market, Remitly has more than 1,800 full-time equivalent employees globally. The mobile-first provider of remittances and financial services for immigrants says it has served over five million customers globally across 75 currencies. Remitly established its fraud and compliance centre of excellence in Cork in June 2020, where it has 110 employees. The company recently took nearly 20,000sq ft at Penrose Dock, a new office complex in Cork’s docklands. In this next phase of growth, Remitly will be hiring for roles that include customer protection associates, programme specialists and compliance analysts. Commenting on the announcement, Leo Varadkar, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, said: “Great news for Cork and I’m sure the company will have no problem filling the new roles with the wealth of talent in the area.” Rene Yoakum, chief customer and people officer at Remitly, said: “We are working to transform the way immigrants send money globally and doing it in a way that is truly customer-centric. We look forward to welcoming 120 new Remitlians to the team who share our passion for serving customers, solving fascinating problems and having fun with talented colleagues.” IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan said Remitly’s announcement “strengthens” the southwest region’s fintech cluster and was a “strong vote of confidence in the highly skilled and talented workforce available” in the area.
