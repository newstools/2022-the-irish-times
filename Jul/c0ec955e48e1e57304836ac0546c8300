Sir, – I recently called to the citizen information service in Rathmines in Dublin to speak to an information officer regarding pension and social security issues to discover that the service has been closed for some time. Callers are encouraged to use online services or phone information. I gave up on numerous efforts of trying to make contact by phone on hearing the usual, “We value your call, however our staff are dealing with a high volume of calls at present”. This is no substitute for face to face information and consultation service. Apparently this closure of a direct service by the citizen information service is happening throughout the country and indeed seems to apply to other public services also, including Revenue offices and social protection services. The reduction of face to face public services particularly affects people with limited or restricted access to online services. All citizens have an entitlement to accessible public services. – Yours, etc, TOM ROWAN, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14.
