Sir, – In his opinion piece (“I’m an Orangeman, and I found the Michaela McAreavey song disgusting and unforgivable”, Weekend Review, June 11th), Richard Mulligan described the Orange Order as a “predominantly Protestant organisation”. Is he not aware that it is actually an exclusively Protestant organisation? That among the requirements of entry are that a member should “strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome and other Non-Reformed faiths”? That membership is generally restricted to those who have two parents of Protestant faith? The Orange Order does not have any rules excluding, for example, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, or Scientologists. But it is explicit in its rules about excluding members of another Christian religion, the Catholic Church. When Mr Mulligan describes what a focal point Orange Halls were for the community when he was growing up, did he not notice that a very substantial part of the community were not present at the fitness classes, bingo, dances or discos he remembers with such fondness? That the Catholic neighbours he worked with in the fields were not even allowed to enter the Orange Hall? The Orange Order and the Royal Black Institution like to hold themselves out as Christian organisations. But all members must know in their hearts that Jesus of Nazareth taught humility and acceptance, not exclusion, and that triumphalist marches in bowler hats and sashes are no display of Christianity. If members of the “loyal organisations” really wanted to demonstrate their Christianity, they could drop all their exclusionary rules, invite their Catholic neighbours to their activities, and seek to make amends for the divisiveness of the past. – Yours, etc, MARK TOTTENHAM, Dalkey, Co Dublin.
