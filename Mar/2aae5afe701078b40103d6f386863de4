Fibrus Networks founder and one-time Ryanair commercial director, Conal Henry, is poised to take the Shannon Group chair following Pádraig Ó Céidigh’s surprise exit. Eamon Ryan, Minister for Transport, named Mr Henry chairman of the State company responsible for Shannon Airport, pending a hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. He will succeed Mr Ó Céidigh, who suddenly left the post last week after around five months. Reports blamed friction between Mr Ó Céidigh and Shannon Group management for his sudden departure. Neither he nor the company commented. Mr Henry will be Shannon Group’s third chair since 2020. He takes over as the airport continues to recover from severe travel restrictions imposed by Government during the Covid-19 pandemic. Airlines began restoring many of Shannon’s routes from late last year but concerns remain locally about its ability to begin growing its network as air travel recovers. Mr Henry is founder and chairman of Belfast-based Fibrus Networks, which provides full-fibre broadband to homes and businesses in the UK. Networks Previously he was chief executive of Enet, which ran metropolitan area broadband networks in the Republic, before its purchase by the Irish Infrastructure Fund in 2017. He was Ryanair’s commercial director between 2002 and 2004 and has served as a non-executive director of Shannon Foynes Port Company for more than nine years. Mr Henry is vice chairman of An Cosán, a community education charity. In Britain, he chaired the National Digital Infrastructure Fund, backed by the country’s treasury. He is a chartered management accountant and has a law degree from from Queen’s University Belfast. Mr Ryan said he was confident that Mr Henry would “play a key role” in leading Shannon Group in its recovery. Minister of State, Hildegarde Naughton, added that he would support Shannon as it emerged from the Covid-19 crisis. Mr Ryan also confirmed that he had accepted Mr Ó Céidigh’s resignation.
