A two-bedroom detached house is an unusual proposition to come across on Trees Road, where it and its neighbouring roads in Mount Merrion are lined with substantial semi-detached homes with good gardens. For a corner house on Sycamore Road, it was its large back garden fronting on to Trees Road that enabled the construction of a downsizer house for a family member about 20 years ago. Now the two-storey, two-bedroom house at number 15A is for sale through Lisney, asking €725,000. Driving into it – there is off street cobblelock parking to the front for two cars – the house looks larger than it is, being wider than it is deep. Inside, the 98sq m (1,054sq ft) of space has been laid out to suit the owner so the two double bedrooms – both en suite – are on different levels, one upstairs, one down, the latter also opening out the patio. The living accommodation is semi-open-plan off a small entrance hall. There is a galley kitchen on one side separated by a wall with a large opening from the dining area in the centre and from there it’s a couple of steps down through a wide-arched opening to the living room. This bright, comfortable room has access via glazed doors to a neat, low-maintenance back patio. Trees Road slopes down to the N11 hence, presumably, the need for the steps down from the dining area to the living room – typically, in a downsizer build, the fewer the steps the better. This property may well appeal to downsizers in the neighbourhood where the opportunity of finding a smaller house to move to are slim, and who would prefer a house over an apartment. It could also appeal to a family buyer prepared to rework the layout – and perhaps extend, planning permitted, to add a further bedroom upstairs. Either way, new owners will almost certainly take a look at the Ber, which is D1.
