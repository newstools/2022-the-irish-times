Three men have appeared before a special sitting of Sligo District Court charged with aggravated burglary at the home of west Sligo farmer Tom Niland. The men, all with addresses in Co Mayo, were charged with aggravated burglary with a knife at the home of Mr Niland at Doonflynn, Skreen, Co Sligo, on January 18th last. All were remanded in custody to appear again at Sligo District Court on March 16th. Det Sgt Michael Kelly from Carrick on Shannon Garda station gave evidence of arrest, charge and caution of all three defendants. He told Judge Sandra Murphy none of the three accused had made any reply when the charge was put to them. The three defendants – John Clarke (33) of Carrowkelly, Ballina, Co Mayo; Francis Harmon (54) Nephin Court, Killala Road, Ballina; and John Irving (28) of Shanwar , Foxford, Co Mayo – were granted legal aid by the judge. Insp Paul Kilcoyne, the senior investigating officer in this case, said the State was objecting to bail in the case of each of the three defendants. No application for bail was made at the brief sitting of the court. Keith O’Grady, counsel for Mr Clarke, instructed by Mullaney Solicitors, said while there was no application for bail being made he was reserving his position on this. The accused was granted free legal aid after solicitor Mark Mullaney told the court he was on disability. Solicitor Pat Loftus, for Francis Harmon, also told the court that he was reserving his position on bail. Applying for free legal aid, he said his client was on jobseeker’s allowance. The judge granted free legal aid . Solicitor Edward Bradberry appeared for Mr Irving, who was also granted free legal aid after the Judge heard he was on jobseeker’s allowance. A small crowd who gathered outside Sligo courthouse shouted at the three accused as they were led inside by gardaí. Mr Niland (73) remains in a critical condition at Sligo University Hospital.
