Sir, – I was struck by the juxtaposition of letters yesterday (July 1st), with Brian O’Brien warning of the risks of misrepresenting data when debating climate change, and Owen Morton providing an example. Mr Morton references Pew Research Center numbers showing US White Protestant Evangelicals much less likely to accept humans are the primary cause of climate change than the religiously unaffiliated, and then asks whether the faithful are the greater threat to humanity. But the same Pew research paper showed that Hispanic Catholics were even more likely to accept the science, and it stressed that the difference between religious affiliations disappears, when you control for politics, race and ethnicity. The Catholic Church in particular is playing a strong role campaigning for social and climate justice. We need to maximise cooperation and minimise division if we are going to effect the huge social changes required to combat the threat of climate change. – Yours, etc, MATT DAVEY, Rathgar, Dublin 6.
