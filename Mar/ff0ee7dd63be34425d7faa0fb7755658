Celtic 2 St Mirren 0 Second-half goals from Cameron Carter-Vickers and Callum McGregor earned Celtic another crucial three Scottish Premiership points against St Mirren at Parkhead. Carter-Vickers lashed home from close range to ease the tension 10 minutes after the break after Celtic had struggled to cut through a well-drilled visiting team. The opener did not open the floodgates by any means but Celtic’s lead was never threatened before McGregor doubled it in the 81st minute when he drilled home from inside the box. The 2-0 victory kept the leaders three points clear of Rangers with nine games remaining, with the defending champions winning 1-0 win away to St Johnstone thanks to a third-minute goal from Glen Kamara.
