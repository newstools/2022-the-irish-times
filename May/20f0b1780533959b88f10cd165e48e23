Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra won the Eurovision song contest in Italy with their entry Stefania, riding a wave of public support to claim an emotional victory. Sung in Ukrainian, the winning song fused rap with traditional folk music and was a tribute to band frontman Oleh Psiuk’s mother. The entry had been sitting in fourth position after the jury votes but leapt to the top spot with a huge public vote for their song Stefania. The UK’s entrant Sam Ryder, who performed his song Space Man, finished second overall, having led the field after the jury votes. Ryder’s performance reverses several years of poor UK showings - the country finished bottom the leader board in both of the past two contests. Others in the running were Spain’s entrant Chanel with her dance number SloMo, and Sweden’s Cornelia Jakobs with Hold Me Closer. The Eurovision final featured the 20 successful nations from the week’s two semi-finals, as well as the so-called big five of the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Ireland’s entry - Brooke Scullion with her track That’s Rich - was eliminated in the second semi-final.
