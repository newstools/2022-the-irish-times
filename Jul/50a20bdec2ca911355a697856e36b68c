Sir, – According to Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore, the safeguarding of children and surrogate mothers were key concerns of the special Oireachtas committee she chaired on surrogacy (“Proposed regulations on international surrogacy include legal rights for parents”, News, July 7th). However, Senator Sharon Keogan has complained several times that potential witnesses with dissenting views on international surrogacy were excluded from the committee’s hearings. Replying to her concerns, Ms Whitmore informed RTÉ's Nine O’Clock News on Wednesday night that, “We did manage to hear from all the voices we needed to hear from.” Is that not how groupthink occurs? – Yours, etc, KARL MARTIN, Bayside, Dublin 13. Sir, – You quote Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore, chairwoman of the Oireachtas Special Committee on International Surrogacy, as saying, “the issue is complex and sometimes divisive and the safeguarding of children and surrogates are key concerns”. Is the taking of newly born babies and giving them to total strangers for cash safeguarding children and surrogates? – Yours, etc, GERALDINE GREGAN, Clare.
