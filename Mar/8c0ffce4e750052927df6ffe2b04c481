Scotland’s Ewen Ferguson will take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Magical Kenya Open as he seeks a maiden victory on the DP World Tour. Ferguson carded an eagle and four birdies in a third round of 66 at Muthaiga Golf Club to reach 14 under par, with Sweden’s Marcus Kinhult and China’s Ashun Wu on 10 under. “It would be unbelievable to win obviously, but I think with everything going on in the world right now golf just means so little and I think that’s in the back of everyone’s minds,” Ferguson said. “I think that’s pretty key as well, there’s so much other stuff going on so I’ll try my best tomorrow and try to grind out the win but if it doesn’t happen I’ll be back again for another chance.” Ferguson began the day a shot off the lead but made the ideal start with a birdie on the first and eagled the par-five fourth before dropping his only shot of the day on the sixth. Three birdies on the back nine gave the 25-year-old Glaswegian a welcome cushion heading into the final day, just three weeks after he finished 130th in a 132-man field in the Ras Al Khaimah Classic following rounds of 76 and 78. “I just kind of wrote that Ras Al Khaimah tournament off because I was just sitting in my room for eight days [with Covid] and didn’t touch a club,” Ferguson added. “I went back home, practised with my coach and family and just didn’t let it get under my skin.” Halfway leader Shubhankar Sharma struggled to a third round of 75 to fall eight shots off the lead. Niall Kearney recovered from opening with three straight bogeys by making an eagle three on the par-four fourth before back-to-back birdies on the seventh and eighth holes got the Dubliner under par by the turn. He went on to card two more birdies and a bogey to sign for a two-under 69 and a share of 39th position on three under. Paul Dunne sits on level par after a level-par 71, Jonathan Caldwell is a shot further back after a 72, while Cormac Sharvin’s seven-over 78 left him on the same mark for the tournament.
