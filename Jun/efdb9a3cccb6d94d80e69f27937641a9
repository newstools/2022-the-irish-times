Sir, – Some drivers say their vehicles “literally” cannot drive at less than 30 km/h (“Drivers complain Phoenix Park speed limit causes engine damage,” News, June 23rd). How do these drivers manage in car parks or at traffic lights? Or is the phenomenon limited to the Phoenix Park? – Yours, etc, BARRY DOHERTY, Dublin 7. Sir, – Your article catalogues a litany of incidents of drivers who seem incapable of operating a mechanically propelled vehicle. Many claim their vehicles are “cutting out”. As a motorist, one would consider “clutch control” a fundamental skill of motoring. Unfortunately, driving standards seem to be plummeting at speeds greater than 30km/h! Perhaps it is time the Minister for Transport introduced mandatory retesting of motorists? The article consists of 515 words, many of which cover the discontent of said motorists. However, only 42 words cover the favourable safety and environmental aspects of the reduction in motoring speeds. – Yours, etc, CON KENNEDY, Dublin 15.
