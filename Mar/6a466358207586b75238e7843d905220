Henry Shefflin has named his panel for this year’s hurling championship, which opens on April 16th, away to Wexford. As well as the retired pair, Joe Canning and Aidan Harte, a number of other players have been left out. Adrian Tuohey, who started the All-Ireland win in 2017 and Niall Burke, who made a big impact coming off the bench in the same match, are both omitted as well as All-Ireland panellist Seán Loftus. All three played at some stage in the league campaign just concluded. Loftus started last year’s championship defeat by Waterford, whereas Tuohey came on as a replacement that day. As previously announced Daithí Burke takes over the captaincy from Pádraic Mannion and Joseph Cooney is named as vice-captain.
