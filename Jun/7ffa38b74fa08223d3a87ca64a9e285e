Sir, – Michael D Higgins as then minister for arts, culture and the Gaeltacht in 1996, despite a chorus of naysayers, was the first minister to bring to government– who published, for the first time – a Government Policy on Architecture, upholding quality. In his foreword Mr Higgins presciently wrote, “I feel it is most important to involve the community at large and to invite the views of citizens who believe that the quality of our built environment makes valuable contributions to the life of the people”. This current Coalition is making a determined effort to correct the housing “disaster” – our President has properly highlighted the urgency of that effort. Currently we have circa 90,000 unbuilt planning permissions and circa 100,000 vacant dwellings. Clearly our systems need urgent attention. – Yours, etc, PAUL LEECH, Ecotect, Kilmainham, Dublin 8. Sir, – Why is everyone so reluctant to confront this issue? What he said was housing is “our great, great, great failure” and “a disaster”. We can delude ourselves if we think this is not getting involved in Government policy. – Yours, etc, BRENDAN O’DONNELL, Glenageary, Co Dublin.
