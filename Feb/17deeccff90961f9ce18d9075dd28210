Tom O’Toole has been ruled out of contention for Ireland’s Six Nations clash with Italy, the IRFU has confirmed. The Ulster prop picked up a hamstring strain during the province’s win over the Dragons on Sunday. His absence leaves Tahdg Furlong and Finlay Bealham as the sole fit tightheads available to Andy Farrell ahead of Italy’s visit to the Aviva Stadium. No replacement for O’Toole has been called into camp and he will return to Ulster to rehabilitate the injury.
