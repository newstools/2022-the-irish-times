Met Éireann has issued a status orange weather warning for heavy rain in five counties, with snow and flooding leading to dangerous driving conditions on some roads. The weather warning, issued by the national forecaster at 3.30pm on Wednesday, covers Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow, Carlow and Kilkenny. Met Éireann has said heavy rain is expected to lead to “surface flooding and poor driving conditions”. The rainfall warning is to remain in effect until 9pm. A status yellow weather warning is in place for the rest of the country, apart from in Dublin and Louth. The yellow rainfall weather warning advises of “hazardous conditions” on roads, due to severe frost and ice on untreated surfaces, and is in place until 10am on Thursday. Waterford City and County Council has advised there is flooding and snowfall reported on several roads in the county. The local authority warned motorists to drive with “extreme care” on roads with heavy snow. Council staff had treated several of the routes with salt, but officials still cautioned motorists to drive with care, and avoid certain roads. Clonmel, Ballymacarbry and Rathgormack should be avoided if possible, the council said. There is also spot flooding reported in Tramore, Pickardstown, Riverdale Estate and Butlerstown. A council spokesman said rainfall was expected to ease shortly, and council officials hoped flooding would then begin to recede. “However overnight temperatures are expected to drop to close to freezing, with snow and ice expected overnight,” the spokesman added. “Waterford City and County Council crews have been deployed to the various locations and are dealing with the situations on the ground. Gritters and snowploughs have been deployed to the Clonmel area,” he said. Wexford County Council’s severe weather assessment team is also meeting to “review preparations” for any disruptions to roads, or spot flooding, a council spokesman said.
