Business services company Concentrix plans to expand its Irish operations with 50 remote working jobs. The company, which has offices in Dublin, Belfast and Derry, said it plans to focus recruitment initially in Co Donegal due to its proximity to its Derry office and the skilled workforce in the region. However, the remote opportunities will be available across the country, and recruitment is already underway. “We see great potential in the Donegal region. With 160,000 residents and a rich pool of talented, well-educated people who we hope will want to come and join an award-winning international company like Concentrix, we are very excited about moving into Donegal and bringing new flexible employment opportunities to the county,” said Sarah McKay, vice-president of service delivery for Concentrix. Concentrix employs more than 270,000 staff worldwide, including more than 4,300 people across Ireland. The company provides customer experience and digital solutions for some of the world’s biggest brands in a range of sectors, including technology and consumer electronics, retail, travel and e-commerce, banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare, communications and media the automotive industry, and energy and public sector. The news was welcomed by Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment Leo Varadkar, who said it demonstrated the Donegal’s attractiveness as a location for investment. “I’m particularly pleased to hear of the flexible nature of these jobs with opportunities to work from home,” he said. “Remote working will be a permanent part of life in Ireland after the pandemic, and it’s great to see Concentrix embrace this shift.” Chief executive of IDA Ireland Martin Shanahan the expansion of the Irish operations was welcome, particularly given the flexible nature of the roles.
