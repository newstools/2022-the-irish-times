The Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) has appointed David O’Sullivan as its new director general, effective from April 4th. Mr O’Sullivan, who was previously ambassador of the EU delegation to the US and is the former Irish secretary general of the European Commission, will succeed Michael Collins in the IIEA role. “I am honoured to take on the role of IIEA director general. At a time of unprecedented change in international affairs it could not be more important to ensure that insightful, independent analysis of European and global affairs is provided to Irish policy-makers and to the Irish public,” Mr O’Sullivan said. The appointment will enable the institute to “continue to thrive and grow into a think tank of international stature”, according to IIEA chairman Ruairí Quinn. “David’s track record of public service at European and international level is unparalleled, and places him in a unique position to lead the institute’s next chapter,” he said. Mr O’Sullivan’s CV includes multiple senior roles, including chief operating officer of the EU’s diplomatic service, the European External Action Service, and European Commission director general of trade. He began his career in the late 1970s at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
