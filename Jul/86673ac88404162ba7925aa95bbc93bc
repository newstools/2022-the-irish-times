Irish aircraft leasing giant Aercap did 184 deals in the three months to the end of June, the company said on Tuesday. Dublin-based Aercap said it agreed to lease 125 aircraft and engines during the second quarter of the year, including 56 jets, 37 helicopters and 32 engines. It bought 13 aircraft, including 10 Airbus jets for its own fleet and three that it will manage on behalf of investors, as well as two helicopters and one engine. The Irish company sold 43 assets in all, including 27 Airbus and Boeing jets, 12 engines and four helicopters. Led by chief executive, Aengus Kelly, New York-listed Aercap is the world’s biggest aircraft lessor. The company buys planes, helicopters and engines by combining its own cash with debt, then leases them to around 300 customers globally.
