Rebuilding thousands of homes affected by mica will likely cost the Government between €149,688 and €421,470 for each house, surveyors have said. However, homeowners will still be left with planning and engineering fees, as well as having to stump up the cost of damaged home contents such as carpets, curtains, furniture and domestic appliances. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien asked the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) to estimate average rebuilding costs for mica-affected homes based on “independent, standalone construction”. Muscovite mica, a mineral, has led to apparent defects in building blocks used in at least 5,000 homes in the northwest, causing cracks to open up in thousands of buildings. The Cabinet last year approved an enhanced scheme to cover repairs or rebuilding for affected homes. In its report published on Thursday, the SCSI said costs of storage, septic tanks, materials salvage, boundary walls and fences as well as outbuildings, such as garages, will not be included in the Government’s grant scheme. It drew up a model, based on eight different house types, typical of about 7,500 homes in Donegal and Mayo that are affected by the defective concrete blocks. The society estimated a two-bedroom terrace estate house (88sq m) would cost €149,688 to rebuild, a three-bedroom semi-detached estate house (98sq m) €165,620 and a four-bed semi-detached estate house (113sq m) €193,456. A four-bed detached estate house (113sq m) would attract a grant up to €200,688 under the calculations, a four-bed single rural bungalow (180sq m) €317,880 and a four-bed single rural dormer (195sq m) €308,685. At the higher end of the scale, a four-bed single rural two-storey (210sq m) would cost €339,150 and a five-bed or more single rural two-storey house (270sq m) €421,470. The Cabinet’s grant scheme includes a €420,000 cap on the level of support on offer, up from €247,500 under a previous version of the scheme. The Mica Action Group along with Opposition politicians have previously called for the sliding scale to be dropped, claiming homeowners would not get 100 per cent redress. They will also be forced to contribute tens of thousands of euro to rebuilding their houses, they warned. It is expected Mr O’Brien will likely adopt the measures suggested by the SCSI.
