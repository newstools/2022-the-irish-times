The Munster football semi-final between Cork and Kerry has been moved from Páirc Uí Rinn due to capacity issues and will now be played at Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney on Saturday, May 7th (6pm throw-in). Páirc Uí Chaoimh was ruled out as a venue for the game due to worries over the condition of the pitch after two Ed Sheeran gigs at the end of April, with Cork planning for a 15,000 attendance at the smaller Páirc Uí Rinn venue. After an annual health and safety inspection on that ground, that capacity was reduced to 9,200, with that rising to a maximum of 11,000 if remedial work was carried out. A Munster statement pointed to the fact that crowds of over 22,000 have attended the last three meetings between the sides where spectators have been allowed, with the decision made to move the game to the larger ground in Killarney. Cork will now host Kerry for the next two meetings between the sides in Munster.
