Sir, – My daughter and her three young children arrived at Terminal One in Dublin from Vancouver at 7.50am on Thursday morning. The flight was early and there was some delay getting to their gate. However, it was in the baggage hall that the trouble really started. Mounds of unclaimed bags were piled everywhere. The bags from her flight eventually came through but hers, among others, were not part of them. After waiting some time, she tried to report this but there was nobody there. In desperation she called me, land side, but once again there was nobody to report to, the information kiosk was unmanned and no airport staff were in evidence. Eventually her bags came through with the bags from a following flight. We left the airport at 10.30 over 2½ hours after her arrival. What a welcome for tourists to Ireland! – Yours, etc, JOHN DAVEY, Kilternan, Co Dublin.
