Two people arrested in connection with the death of primary school teacher Ashling Murphy in January have been released from custody. Gardaí said a file on the pair, a man and woman aged in their sixties who were arrested on suspicion of withholding information, will now be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). They had been held under Section Four of the Criminal Justice Act but were released on Thursday evening. Ms Murphy (23) was killed while she was out running along the Grand Canal near Tullamore, Co Offaly on January 12th. Her death prompted a huge outpouring of emotion and widespread expressions of concern over the safety of women generally and prompted calls for new legislation and the establishment of a specific government unit to deal with the issue. Jozef Puska (31), with an address at Lynally Grove, Mucklagh, Co Offaly, was later charged with her murder at a special sitting of Tullamore District Court. Last week he was further remanded in custody pending formal directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). He is due to appear in court again on March 9th.
