Three days after winning her 15th national senior title Phil Healy produced another indoor best time over 400 metres when finishing third at the World Athletics Tour Indoor final in Madrid. Healy’s time of 51.66 seconds was again just shy of the 20-year-old Irish record of 51.58 by Karin Shinkins, all five of Healy’s main races over 400m this indoor season being under 52 seconds. Victory on the night went to Poland’s European Indoor champion Justyna Swiety Ersetic in 51.21. Healy’s time is also inside the qualifying time for the European outdoor championships in Munich this summer, Healy now moving on to the World Indoors in Belgrade on the weekend after next. Earlier Sophie Becker won the 400 B final in 52.98, ending up with an overall ranking of fourth on the night, having run a best of 52.64 in second place behind Healy at last Sunday’s National Championships, also a World Indoor standard. Sarah Lavin also took third place in the 60m hurdles final, clocking 8.14 seconds, having run 8.08 to qualify, her second fastest time ever. Victory there went to Zoe Sedney of the Netherlands in 7.95. All three women move on to Belgrade, Athletics Ireland due to announce the Irish team later this week.
