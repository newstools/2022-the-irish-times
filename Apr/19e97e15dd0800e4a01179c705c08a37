Edpac, an Irish manufacturer of data centre cooling equipment, is seeking to fill 30 new roles after it was acquired by the Munters Group earlier this year for €29 million. The company, which is based in Carrigaline, Co Cork, will change name to Munters from Monday. It said it is actively hiring and that the jobs would be filled within 12 months. Electricians, operators and project managers are among the roles that are currently being recruited at the manufacturing facility. Edpac’s client list includes several of the largest hyperscale and co-location data centre providers in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It has been a manufacturing partner for Munters’ Oasis systems for a number of years. Headquartered in Sweden, Munters is a climate control products provider of energy efficient data centre cooling products in North America. Munters’ CEO Klas Forsström said the deal with Edpac further strengthens its presence in Europe. “The European data centre market is a prioritised segment for Munters and the acquisition is a significant step in our growth strategy,” he said.
