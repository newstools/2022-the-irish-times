Frenkie de Jong is open to joining Manchester United from Barcelona, in a significant development in Erik ten Hag’s pursuit of the midfielder. De Jong has previously stated contentment at the Catalan club and is thought to have been unsure regarding United lack’s of Champions League football. Yet according to reports in the Guardian the 25-year-old is now minded to sign for United and rejoin Ten Hag after working under the Dutchman at Ajax. [ Manchester United agree €17m deal for Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia ] A fee of an initial €65m (£56.2m) plus add-ons that could take it to €85m has been agreed in principle and negotiations are now centred around the player’s personal terms. Tyrell Malacia, the Feynoord left-back, is keen to sign for United and the deal is expected to be signed off soon. Ajax’s Lisandro Martínez and Antony remain of interest to Ten Hag but the Eredivise champions may be reluctant to sell. There is hope at United that Christian Eriksen could join after previously signalling a preference to remain in London – probably at Brentford – though there is recognition that the Dane has a lot of factors to consider regarding his future. – Guardian
