Dublin Port chief executive Eamonn O’Reilly will leave the company at the end of August, after 12 years in the role. His period in charge of the State-owned company saw business volumes grow by one-quarter and profits by more than one-third, while also dealing with the trade implications of Brexit and the hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. More than €500 million was spent on port infrastructure during that time. Companies based in Dublin’s docklands recently called for the port to be moved from the mouth of the Liffey, saying more than 200 hectares of land could be better used for housing and offices. Mr O’Reilly dismissed the proposal and has consistently rejected suggestions from various quarters that Dublin Port should be relocated. Dublin Port Company chairman Jerry Grant said he was “very sorry” to see Mr O’Reilly depart. “Eamonn has made a great contribution to Dublin Port over the past 12 years and has built up a top-class management team to continue the work of Masterplan 2040 in the coming years. He has left a lasting legacy in terms of the strategic development of the port, its reintegration with the city and the exceptional executive team managing this vital public infrastructure.” Mr Grant said he hoped to attract a strong field of candidates for the role in the recruitment process that is now underway. Commenting on his decision to leave, Mr O’Reilly said: “When I took the job in 2010, I did not envisage that I would still be here 12 years later. Having gone through Brexit and with all three masterplan projects up and running – two under construction – it’s the right time for me to move on. “At this stage, Dublin Port is well resourced in terms of plans, finance and people to maintain the momentum needed to deliver the additional cargo handling capacity that is required and to consolidate the revived relationship between the port and the city. I am looking forward with excitement to the new challenges and opportunities ahead.”
