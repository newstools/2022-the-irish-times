Head coach Greg McWilliams has named nine uncapped players in a 38-strong squad for the Women’s Six Nations, due to get underway at the end of this month. Following the recent conclusion of the AIL campaign, the squad is due to start preparations for the championship this weekend at the IRFU high performance centre. Fresh off securing a second ever AIL crown, Railway Union see four players among the uncapped contingent, prop Amanda McQuade among them alongside Anna McGann, Emma Murphy and Molly Scuffil-McCabe. Beaten finalists Blackrock also have a number of new faces who have been called up in Christy Haney, Aoife Wafer, Aoibheann Reilly and Natasja Behan. Sale Sharks’ Vicky Irwin - who has been identified as Irish qualified through the IQ Rugby programme, is the other uncapped player. No captain has been named as of yet to replace the retired Ciara Griffin. Sene Naoupu, Cliodhna Moloney and Anna Caplice are among the bigger names to have missed out. Commenting on his squad announcement, McWilliams said: “I am really pleased with the balance of the squad, there is great youth and experience and I have been impressed by the form of these players in recent weeks. “We have selected players that have the ability to go for long periods of high intensity ball in play and have a positive impact on the game. Like every selection, there is some talent missing out, and I will be keeping an eye on these and other players as we look to increase competition within the wider playing pool. “There is great talent within the group and this is a great opportunity for us to develop its foundations and learn about what’s needed to compete at the highest level going forward. “For now, we are just excited to start, to put the head down and work hard. We are relishing the prospect of running out in front of our home supporters at The RDS for the first game of the championship.” Ireland were last in action in November, securing a pair of wins over Japan and the USA. Greg McWilliams’ squad gets the Six Nations campaign underway against Wales on March 26th.
