AnkerMake M5 €585 The idea of 3D printing is great. You have endless possibilities at your fingertips; as long as you can design it, you can print it. But in reality, it can be a slow process, or at least the consumer-accessible printers are. Anker’s new 3D printing brand, AnkerMake, is hoping to make that a thing of the past, promising smarter, faster printing. Its new M5 printer claims to work up to five times faster, and more precisely than its competitors so you get better curves. It also has a built-in AI Camera Recognition system to keep your prints on track and how they should be, and monitor for blockages and other problems that could hit your prints. Plus it can be operated remotely, adding to the convenience of the process. ankermake.com
