United Rugby Championship: Connacht v Stormers Kick-off: 1pm, Saturday. Venue: The Sportsground. On TV: Live on RTÉ2. Andy Friend has made four changes to the Connacht squad for their United Rugby Championship game against the Stormers at The Sportsground from last week’s historic win away to the Scarlets. With Dave Heffernan and Jack Carty returning to Ireland duty, they’ve been replaced in the starting team by Shane Delahunt and Conor Fitzgerald respectively. The other changes sees the return of Denis Buckley to the front row, while Alex Wootton comes onto the wing with John Porch moving to fullback. The rest of the squad is unchanged, meaning Tietie Tuimauga, Niall Murray and Leva Fifita complete the tight five, while the back row consists of Cian Prendergast, captain Jarrad Butler and Paul Boyle. Kieran Marmion remains at scrumhalf, as do Tom Daly and Sammy Arnold in the centre. Peter Sullivan completes the side from the right wing. The coaches have opted for a 6-2 split on the bench, with Abraham Papali’i wearing the number 23 jersey. “We are close to must-win territory for all our remaining games in the URC, so that’s why last week’s win was so important for us,” said Friend. “We have done our scout on the Stormers and are very aware of the threats that they bring. We know that we will have to front up physically as they’re a big team. “We’re in a strong position in terms of available players outside the Irish contingent, so it’s a 23 I know are capable of a winning performance in front of our home fans.” Connacht: John Porch; Peter Sullivan, Sammy Arnold, Tom Daly, Alex Wootton; Conor Fitzgerald, Kieran Marmion; Denis Buckley, Shane Delahunt, Tietie Tuimauga; Niall Murray, Leva Fifita; Cian Prendergast, Jarrad Butler (capt), Paul Boyle. Replacements: Jonny Murphy, Jordan Duggan, Jack Aungier, Oisin Dowling, Conor Oliver, Caolin Blade, Tom Farrell, Abraham Papali’i.
