This week, two great summer wines from Aldi for less than €9. The first would be perfect for sipping poolside, or with a light leafy salad. The second is a fuller-bodied red to drink with barbecued red meats. Lively, thirst-quenching green fruits and lime zest, finishing dry. Perfect on its own on a warm summer evening, or with creamy goat’s cheese, green salads or grilled fish. Go Portuguese and try it with grilled sardines. €8.99 from Aldi From the south of France, a medium- to full-bodied red with enticing aromas, ample supple, smooth strawberry fruits and a rounded finish. Try it with barbecued beef, lamb and pork, or roast Mediterranean vegetables. €8.99 from Aldi
