He has been with Leinster as a coach since 2018 after a stint as a player for the province betwen 2003-2009. The outhalf was at the club when they secured their first Heineken Cup win in 2009 but memorably missed the final due to an injury, opening the door for Johnny Sexton to become first choice at the position. Cheika was the coach of that side and now seems set to link up with his former player in a coaching capacity.
