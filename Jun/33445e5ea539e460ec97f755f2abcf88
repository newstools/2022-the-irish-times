Sir, – The report recently published by the ESRI, Disrupted Transitions? Young Adults and the Covid-19 Pandemic, shows we are far from “out of the woods” when considering the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of the country’s young people. The classification of four-in-ten 22-year-old men and 55 per cent of 22-year-old women as depressed, while not entirely unexpected, is deeply saddening. Depression is isolating and difficult to overcome alone. Young people must be able to readily access supports and tools to help them cope and emerge from these most difficult, and hitherto unknown, challenges. The Government has acknowledged the impact of Covid-19 on mental health. While the pandemic may have receded, its impact will be felt long into the future if we do not act now. Waiting lists for mental health services continue to grow due to an increase in mental health needs, compounded by a lack of capacity in the public health system. Mental Health Reform has highlighted the need for investment in early intervention which plays a critical role in addressing mental health difficulties and reducing the need for more complex and costly treatment. Better access to primary care and specialist services would contribute to greater resilience, wellbeing and improved mental health outcomes for young people. During Covid-19, the best of society’s qualities shone through. Communities mobilised to support each other, and we pulled together and recognised our own vulnerabilities. We must not forget that now. A generation of young people are struggling, and we must ensure that mental health remains at the top of the national agenda for them, and future generations. – Yours, etc, RÓISÍN CLARKE, Interim CEO, Mental Health Reform, Dublin 7.
