Hotel investors and operators looking for opportunities for the upcoming summer season may be interested in the sale of a boutique four-star hotel in a prime location on the Wild Atlantic Way. Situated at the heart of Castletownbere in west Cork, the 16-bedroom Beara Hotel offers the prospective purchaser ample opportunity to develop a highly profitable business. The property is being marketed by agent Colliers at a guide price of €1.5 million. The Beara Hotel briefly includes 16 bedroom suites, six of which have balconies overlooking the harbour, a function room with capacity for 300 attendees, a bar with casual-dining facilities, a library/conference room, fully-fitted commercial kitchens, and a spacious reception area. The hotel underwent a full upgrade in 2016. The works carried out at the time included the refitting of all bathrooms, upgrading of the bars, restaurant and ballroom, and the full equipping of its kitchen facilities. Castletownbere itself is a picturesque coastal town and one of the five main fishing ports on the island of Ireland. Situated on the Beara Peninsula, an area famed for its landscape, the town offers visitors a twice-daily ferry connection to nearby Bere Island.
