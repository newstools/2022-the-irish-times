Three new city centre hubs to support Ukrainian nationals who have fled the Russian invasion have been established by the Government. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the “Ukraine support centres” in Dublin, Cork and Limerick will assist Ukrainians in obtaining PPS numbers, availing of social welfare income supports, and receiving referrals to other State services. She said the centres at Cork Street in Dublin 8 and Hanover Quay in Cork City are now open to support families and individuals who have arrived in Ireland. The centres will be open on Friday and Saturday from 9.15am to 3pm. From Monday, they will be open from 9.15am to 5pm. A third hub will be opened in Limerick next week. The opening of these new hubs follows on from the launch last week of a “one-stop shop” in Dublin Airport by Ms Humphreys and Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. Representatives from the Citizens Information Service will also be available in the hubs to help people with enquiries of a more general nature. Community welfare officers will also assist with applications for financial support. Interpretation services are available at the centres. “These dedicated hubs in Dublin, Cork and Limerick will ensure that Ukrainian families and individuals who have fled this terrible war can get the supports they need as quickly as possible,” said Ms Humphreys. “My officials are present in these new centres, as well as our Intreo Centres, to assist the Ukrainian people in obtaining the likes of a PPS Number – which is a crucial first step to accessing different services offered by the State. “We have already issued over 5,000 PPS Numbers to people who have arrived from Ukraine since the start of the invasion by Russia. “We have also provided many families and individuals with income supports such as Supplementary Welfare Allowance . “I want the people of Ukraine to know that my department is here to help and support you in every way we can.”
