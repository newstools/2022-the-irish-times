A total of 83 complaints about increases in the price of petrol and diesel were made to the consumer watchdog, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). The number of complaints prompted the CCPC to write to fuel retailers to remind them of the rules surrounding fuel retailing. The action follows disquiet that many fuel retailers put up the price of a litre of petrol by about 20 cent, just one day before the Government reduced excise and duties on a litre of petrol by 20 cent – a move which had been widely anticipated. Similar activities in relation to a reduction of 15 cent in the price of a litre of diesel were made to the CCPC. The CCPC is understood to have written to Minister of State with responsibility for consumer protection, Robert Troy, advising him of the actions it was taking to protect motorists. The Irish Times asked Mr Troy for a comment and one is anticipated. However, according to the CCPC the market has been greatly impacted by the war in Ukraine and prices have become volatile. The CCPC also said there are “no legal barriers” to petrol stations independently increasing prices and the authority does not have a role in monitoring such increases. Where the CCPC can step in is if it believes fuel retailers may be acting as a cartel in setting prices. Where it has evidence of cartel behaviour before it would launch an investigation, the CCPC said. But in a comment last Thursday the authority said there was nothing to stop petrol stations “acting independently to increase their prices”. “The CCPC does not have a role in monitoring price increases in the market. “If businesses collude to fix prices this is cartel behaviour and the CCPC can investigate and refer a case to the DPP for criminal prosecution.” It said further information on cartels and how the public can submit evidence to the CCPC is available on its website.
