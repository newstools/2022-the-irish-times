Cairn Homes is to lodge plans for almost 1,400 residential units in three separate fast-track planning applications in the coming days. The house builder has given notice that it will lodge plans for two sites in north Dublin and a third at Greystones in Co Wicklow. Cairn is seeking permission for a Strategic Housing Development (SHD) scheme comprising 621 residential units on a 14-hectare (35-acre) site at Hollybanks, Swords, in north Dublin. The scheme is made up of 145 one-bed units, 278 two-bed units, 187 three-bed units and 11 four-bed units. It includes 118 houses and 349 apartments in two blocks ranging in height from two to seven storeys, and 154 duplex units. Donabate scheme In a separate SHD, Cairn will seek permission for the construction of 154 apartments at Ballymastone, Donabate, in north Dublin. The scheme is made up of 54 one-bed units, 87 two-bed units and 13 three-bed units in five blocks ranging in height from three to six storeys. In the third case, Cairn is seeking permission for 586 residential units for a site at Coolagad, northwest of Greystones town centre. It comprises 351 two-storey houses, 203 apartments and 32 duplex units. Cairn initially proposed a 607-unit scheme, made up of 405 houses and 202 apartments. However, the developer reduced the number of units after An Bord Pleanála told the company that the proposed scheme required further consideration or amendment. In its latest SHD decision, An Bord Pleanála has granted permission to Cork firm O’Flynn Construction for the development of 275 residential units made up of 205 houses and 70 apartments at Ballyhooly Road, Ballyvolane, Cork. The three-field site is located about 450m north of the junction with North Ring Road, on the fringe of Cork city.
