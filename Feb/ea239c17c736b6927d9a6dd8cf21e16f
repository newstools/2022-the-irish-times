Dublin-based AerCap has signed agreements with Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA for the lease of ten new Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft and eight Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft. The company said on Monday that the aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in 2022 and 2023. “We are delighted to support Norwegian’s narrowbody fleet renewal program,” said chief commercial officer Peter Anderson. “The addition of these aircraft will help Norwegian grow their operations whilst maintaining its commitment to operate a highly competitive, fuel-efficient fleet of aircraft. “We wish Geir Karlsen and all the team every success and we look forward to working with them as these aircraft deliver.” Norwegian Air chief executive Geir Karlsenn said the addition of the aircraft would help the group achieve its target of building a larger, modern and more fuel-efficient fleet. “This will in turn enable us to deliver our products and services in a wide network of routes in the Nordics and to European destinations,” he added. AerCap serves approximately 300 customers around the world. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is based in Dublin with offices in Shannon, Miami, Singapore, Amsterdam, Shanghai, Abu Dhabi, Seattle, Toulouse and other locations around the world.
