Westmeath 2-15 Wexford 0-21 A dramatic additional time goal from substitute Derek McNicholas handed Westmeath a deserved draw and left Wexford’s championship hopes in tatters at Cusack Park, Mullingar on Saturday. Wexford now need a victory over Kilkenny in their final round game to keep their championship hopes alive. Westmeath created all the early chances but their finishing was wayward, shooting six wides in the opening six minutes. Wexford, with their first real attack, saw Rory O’Connor point after five minutes with the same player adding a second two minutes later. Lee Chin, in just his second start of the campaign pointed a free, with Conor McDonald then firing over a fine point from an acute angle. The home side had to wait until the 10th minute for their opening score with wing-back Aaron Craig pointing from distance. Chin and Killian Doyle exchanged frees before the first goal of the match arrived in the 25th minute, when a long ball from Niall Mitchell was dropped by Wexford goalkeeper Mark Fanning into the corner of the net behind him. Wexford went in with just a single point interval lead - 0-12 to 1-8. After Chin and McGovern extended Wexford’s lead it looked as if they were about to take control, but Doyle’s accuracy from frees kept the hosts in touch. Wexford were left clinging to a three point lead - 0-20 to 1-14 - with the game moving into additional time. Doyle launched a high ball into the goalmouth and Derek McNicholas forced the ball over the line for a dramatic equalising goal, six minutes into additional time.
