Sir, – The controversy over Leo Varadkar’s passing of the Irish Medical Organisation “deal” to a rival organisation has obscured the question of why the IMO has a monopoly over negotiation with the Government, and why an “upstart” union representing younger members has been excluded and marginalised. Most people agree that the Irish health system is dysfunctional, yet the vested interests represented by the IMO remain beyond reproach. Describing the IMO as a union is really a stretch of the word; it is more reminiscent of a cartel determined to preserve the power and status of its older, more powerful members. Ireland has poured vast sums into its health system, yet the orchestrated media political campaign to hobble Leo Varadkar for the sin of not showing due deference to the IMO has demonstrated that this will not change any time soon. – Yours, etc, Dr ALEX HARTINGTON, Sliema, Malta. Sir, – All’s well that ends well. The question that remains unanswered is why did it take the DPP forever to make a call on this controversy. Surely it can’t have been that complicated! – Yours, etc, TADHG McCARTHY, Bray, Co Wicklow. Sir, – It was entertaining while it lasted. I am reminded of a Saki quote: “Think how many blameless lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people.” – Yours, etc, MARY KEANE, Dublin 8. Sir, – The Tánaiste may have escaped prosecution for leaking confidential documents, an action which he admitted was wrong and for which he apologised. There is a need in politics to do something beneficial rather than just be something. – Yours, etc, HUGH McDERMOTT, Dromahair, Co Leitrim.
