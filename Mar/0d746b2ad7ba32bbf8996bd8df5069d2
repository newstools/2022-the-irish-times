Ireland’s June clashes against Ukraine are now in doubt after Scotland’s World Cup play-off tie against the same opposition was postponed due to Russia’s invasion of its eastern European neighbour. The qualifying fixture was scheduled to take place at Hampden Park on March 24th, with the winner facing either Austria or Wales for a place in this year’s tournament in Qatar. However, the match has now been postponed until June after members of the Scotland, Ukraine, Wales and Austria Football Associations were told of the postponement by Fifa on Monday. Reports suggest that the game could now take place on June 4th, which is when Stephen Kenny’s Ireland is due to host Ukraine in a Uefa Nations League fixture. This would present a further scheduling headache for Ireland given their June 14th tie away to Ukraine in Lviv is all but certain to be moved due to the ongoing invasion.
