The director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory at UCD, Dr Cillian De Gascun, has urged people who have not yet had their booster vaccine to do so as it will continue to protect against serious illness and hospitalisation, despite changes in the virus itself. Dr De Gascun told RTÉ Radio’s News at One that while the BA.4 and BA.5 variants now account for 85 per cent of cases in the State, the vaccines available were still working. “It’s important to try to reassure people that while these viruses have a growth advantage and are more contagious than BA1 and BA.2, it’s a minor change in behaviour, we’re not going back to a previous virus like Alpha and Delta,” Dr De Gascun said.

There are no major causes for concern” At some point in the future the vaccine will have to be changed to match changes in the virus, he said. Covid was not the same as influenza which evolves at a far faster rate, and so flu vaccines had to change from year to year. “The vaccines that we have at the moment [for Covid] are still very good.”
