HSBC has named Laura Trimble as the next chief executive of its Irish operation, putting her in charge of the London-headquartered banking giant’s 350 employees in the Republic. Subject to regulatory approval, Ms Trimble will succeed Alan Duffy, who had held the position for almost eight years and has now taken on the new role of head of sustainable finance for HSBC Europe Commercial Banking. The new chief executive will also be head of HSBC’s wholesale banking business in Ireland, leaving her responsible commercial banking, global banking and securities services operations from Dublin. Investment She has more than 15 years’ experience working in corporate and investment banking, notably in the equity capital markets, and has most recently been managing HSBC Commercial Banking’s origination activity across Europe, according to the bank. “Ireland is a key corridor for global commerce because it connects Europe with the rest of the world,” said Ms Trimble. “We are ambitious to grow our business further here and to become the preferred international banking partner for our clients, particularly in sustainable finance.” Andy Wild, chief executive of HSBC Continental Europe, said: “Ireland represents a key market for our international wholesale banking strategy in Europe. With her extensive corporate and investment banking background, Laura is well placed to lead the next phase of growth in our Irish business.”
