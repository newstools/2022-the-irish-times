Rosses Point bared its fangs as a southerly wind gusting over 30mph at times sent scores soaring in the second qualifying round for the Connolly’s Audi West of Ireland Amateur Open at County Sligo. Dundalk’s Caolan Rafferty made the most of the fine but breezy early conditions and added a two-over 73 to his opening 65 to remain out in front with a round to go in the 54-hole strokeplay test to find the top 16 who qualify for the matchplay stages from Monday. The former Walker Cup player mixed 17 pars with a double-bogey six at the 14th to head the field by three strokes from Roscommon’s Thomas Higgins and Galway’s Liam Nolan on four under par. Higgins shot the only sub-par score of the day in the morning, a one-under 70 featuring a birdie at the second, an eagle at the fifth and bogeys at the 15th and 17th before the wind got up and scores soared into the 80s and 90s. The final five holes were playing into the teeth of the wind for the later starters and Nolan was pleased to play that stretch in three over par for a 73. “I made a lot of up and downs in the first 12 holes to be one under, but then you turn for home, and it was a case of hanging on to your hat,” said Irish international Nolan, who was runner-up to Royal Dublin’s Hugh Foley in a 72-hole strokeplay West of Ireland last September. “So I was very happy with the 73 today.” Ballybofey and Stranorlar’s Ryan Griffin shot a level-par 71 early in the day to finish on level par and tied for fourth with Foley, who was two under with six to go and thrilled to negotiate the tough closing stretch in two over for a 72 on a day when the field averaged 78.29 compared to 75.08 on day one. “A 72 felt like a great score in the end, even though I was two under with six to play,” said Foley, who bogeyed the 14th, 16th and 18th but parred the 15th and 17th, where he hit two drivers short of the green before spinning a 30-yard wedge shot back to six inches from the hole to save par. “The last five holes played really tough. I hit a 4-iron into the 14th [460 yards], a 5-iron to the 15th [422 yards], a 2-iron to the par-three 16th [210 yards] and I was short in two after two drivers to the 17th [470 yards], which was like a par-5 today. Even the 18th [387 yards] was a drive and a chipped 4-iron when it was a lob wedge in there yesterday. “I was happy with the way I played. It was a great test of the long game with the last few into the wind a serious test.” The new format – 54 holes of strokeplay with the top 16 to qualify for the matchplay – is being trialled this year and next to get a better quality matchplay contest on Monday and Tuesday. Bar US-based Alex Maguire and Mark Power, 10 of the 12-strong high-performance panel are in action this week and nine of them are in the top 20 with one qualifying round remaining. But with 50 players already more than 10 strokes outside the top 16 and wind and rain forecast for round three, it’s no surprise to see 19 players withdrawing and the starting field of 132 reduced to 111 with an additional two players retiring.
