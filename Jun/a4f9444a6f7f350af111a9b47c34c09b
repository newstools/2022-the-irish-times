Andrew Goodman, currently an assistant with the Crusaders, has emerged as the favourite to succeed Felipe Contepomi as Leinster’s attack coach after the latter moves on to his new role working as an assistant to Michael Cheika with Argentina. The 39-year-old New Zealander played 17 times in midfield for Leinster in the 2012-13 season in a career which also saw him play for his home province Tasman, whom he captained, as well as a stint in Japan with the Toyota Industries Shuttle. He became head of the Nelson College rugby academy in 2015, was a part of the Tasman Mako coaching group since 2016 until last year, becoming their head coach. He became the Crusaders backs coach last year as they retained their Super Rugby Aotearoa title, and on Friday they beat the Chiefs 20-7 to reach the final again.
