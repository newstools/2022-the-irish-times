Sir, – I am glad I am of an age when, in 2035, I will not be around to see the completion of the current major Government projects. I am referring to the National Children’s Hospital, the new National Maternity Hospital, the Dublin Metrolink project, the Mica redress scheme and the continued delay in increasing the old age pension commencement date in spite of us all living longer than our parents. The total aggregate costs of these projects should then be clear and the Government will be broke. Perhaps our EU colleagues should be warned now so that bailout plans can be prepared. Should I be proved right please add to my gravestone in Shanganagh Cemetery the words, “For once he was right”. – Yours, etc, DAVID McCABE, Shankill, Dublin 18. Sir, – I see that the proposed Metrolink will cost at least €9.5 billion and will be completed between 2031 and 2034. Extrapolating from previous large public building projects (the Luas, the Port Tunnel, the National Children’s Hospital etc), I predict that Metrolink will cost between €25 billion and €30 billion and will not be completed before 2040, by which time I will probably be pushing up daisies. You read it here first. – Yours, etc, COLIN C MURPHY, Dublin 6W. Sir, – Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan says that Metrolink could be expanded to the southeastern suburbs at some point in the future. Why is he not expanding it as part of the present build? Once they’ve started the tunnelling machine, they can just keep going. – Yours, etc, TIM SWEETMAN, Graiguenamanagh, Co Kilkenny.
