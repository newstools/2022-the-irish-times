For all of the wonderful shots which Justin Thomas hit in claiming the 104th US PGA Championship in a play-off win at Southern Hills in Tulsa, the 29-year-old American’s recall of a tough-love conversation with his veteran caddie Jim “Bones” Mackay showcased the slim margins between success and failure. “I’m fully confident in saying I wouldn’t be standing here [with the Wanamaker Trophy] if he didn’t give me that talk,” said the player of his bagman’s intervention on Saturday evening after Thomas had signed for a third-round 74 that he believed had played him out of the championship, seven shots adrift of Mito Pereira after 54 holes. Mackay, the long-time caddie to Phil Mickelson before their parting in 2017, had come out of a new career in on-course broadcasting to hook up with Thomas after last year’s Ryder Cup and was the solid voice in his ear when it mattered. As Thomas described it, he was frustrated and angry with how he had scored in the third round. “I felt like I’d played terrible. And he was like, ‘Dude, you’ve got to stop being so hard on yourself. You’re in contention every single week we’re playing. I’ve had a lot of chances to win tournaments, and it’s a hard golf course; it’s a major championship. You don’t have to be perfect. Just don’t be so hard on yourself, just kind of let stuff happen and everything is trending in the right direction. So just keep staying positive so that good stuff can happen’.” The upshot was that Thomas left Southern Hills in what he said was “an awesome frame of mind.” It was a positive mentality that he took with him into the final round, undeterred by the shot on the sixth tee, executing a full-blooded shank at one point amid what was otherwise a masterclass in chasing down and then closing the deal. “I just cold shanked it, I don’t really know how else to say it. It was the best bogey I’ve ever made in my life, that’s for sure,” remarked Thomas. But there was far more good than bad in a final round of 67 for a total of 275. He would go on to beat Will Zalatoris in the three-hole aggregate play-off. Thomas’s second PGA title moved him to fifth in the official world rankings and gave him a first win since last year’s Players. He is also of the belief that he is a more improved player now than when he first lifted the trophy at Quail Hollow in 2017: “I’ve matured a lot. Five years is a long time, especially at this stage of my life. I would like to think and hope that everything has just gotten a little better. There’s nothing that’s like standing out of a massive difference. I would say the biggest difference is I probably just weigh about 15 pounds more, I’ve put on some weight. “The big part of it is you just want to get one per cent better. I don’t need to revamp everything. I don’t need to hit it 30 yards farther. I don’t need to change equipment, change ball... it’s just everything that I have and been doing has been working. It’s just trying to just get it a little bit better. I just feel like that’s what I’ve done in every facet. There’s nothing that stands out, like that is monumentally better. But it’s all improved.” While Thomas took his chance so impressively, there were many others who could look back believing it was one that got away. Not least Zalatoris, or maybe even more so Pereira. But also Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick. And Rory McIlroy, too, could be included in that number who failed to close the deal. For Séamus Power, with a career-first top-10, it was different. For the 35-year-old Waterford man competing in just his second major championship, there was further proof of how far he has come in the past year in terms of his golfing trajectory with his tied-ninth place finish moving him to a career best 40th in the official world rankings and securing his place in next month’s US Open at Brookline and the 150th Open at St Andrews in July. “I can’t complain too much. The last year, I have been in some sort of contention regularly enough and it definitely helps, it is something to lean on. I know they haven’t been majors but you learn a lot and learn things that make you a little calmer and a little more confident... I [was] obviously disappointed coming off the course but overall I think I will look back and be very satisfied with top-10,” Power told RTÉ Radio.
