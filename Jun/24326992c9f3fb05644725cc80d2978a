Sir, – With their usual degree of clarity and insight, Prof Harford and Dr Fleming from UCD are again spot on, this time in their call on the Minister for Education to urgently advise schools of their entitlements under the Covid Learning and Supports Scheme (Class) hours for the forthcoming academic year (Letters, June, 20th). They pinpoint that crucially, in order to make best use of resources, a school principal needs to have a clear picture of what will be at their disposal well in advance of the forthcoming school year. If only this were the case. During the pandemic, the Department of Education provided additional funding to schools to support the enhanced cleaning required for infection prevention and control. This support was much warranted and welcome in our fight against the introduction and spread of Covid 19. Many schools were able to hire additional cleaning staff who proved to be indispensable in helping to keep everyone safe. Yet now within a week of many schools closing for the summer break, despite their essential and commendable service to our school communities, the employment fate of these cleaning staff hangs in the balance. Schools have inexplicably still not been told what funding they will receive, if any, for next year for enhanced cleaning in our schools. Out of respect to our cleaning staff colleagues, to assist in the effective management of resources in our schools, and in light of the current spike in Covid 19 cases, it is now time for the Department of Education to bite the bullet and immediately notify schools of the enhanced cleaning grant they will receive next year. It is, after all, an essential cost of living – with Covid 19. – Yours, etc, JOHN McHUGH, Principal, Ardscoil Rís, Dublin 9.
