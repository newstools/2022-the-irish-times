Bank of Ireland is to create 100 new technology-focused jobs. This is in addition to the 130 IT specialist roles it announced last April. The recruitment drive comes as the bank continues with its multimillion-euro digital transformation programme. Bank of Ireland said it is seeking technical architects, software developers, engineers, specialised project managers, scrum masters and data analysts to join its in-house tech teams. The roles are open to candidates from across the State; in line with the bank’s flexible work policies, applicants will be able to work from a combination of home and central office locations, and from a network of 11 remote working hubs. “We are delighted to announce the recruitment of these technology positions, which are critical in terms of how we serve our customers today and develop our business into the future,” said Eimear Harty, HR director, group technology and customer solutions. ‘Ambitious’ “We have many colleagues with deep technology expertise and these new positions will add to this. We are ambitious for the development of our digital services, and we offer a very progressive approach to flexible working. All this combined makes Bank of Ireland an exciting place to build a career right now.” Bank of Ireland said the move to online banking continues apace, with mobile app log-ins growing 63 per cent last year and contactless transactions up 43 per cent to 244 million. Ms Harty said 94 per cent of Bank of Ireland’s everyday product applications were now digitised. The bank’s remote working hubs are in Swords, Blanchardstown, Santry, Newlands Cross, Gorey, Mullingar, Newbridge, Dundalk, Northern Cross, Balbriggan and Naas. Bank of Ireland announced 130 tech roles last April. Among the roles it sought at that time were technical architects, software developers, engineers, specialised project managers and data analysts.
