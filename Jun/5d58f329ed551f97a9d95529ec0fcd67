Jack Horgan-Jones is one of many parents paying through the nose for childcare. The Government wants to take some of the financial pain out of childcare with new funding. Will the plan work? Harry McGee plugs his new podcast GUBU, a seven-part thriller about a series of grisly murders in the 1980s and how they impacted the government of Charles Haughey. And Denis Staunton has the latest from London where PM Boris Johnson lives to fight another day after winning a confidence vote. The Irish Times Inside Politics podcast is hosted this week by Pat Leahy.
