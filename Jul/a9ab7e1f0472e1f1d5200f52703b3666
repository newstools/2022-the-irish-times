Sir, – May I suggest that the complaint about public transport to the Marlay Park concerts (Letters, July 4th) is due to the fact that this is a public park in a highly residential area and not a suitable venue for large concerts. There is a 25-minute walk from the Luas to Marlay Park and three buses that will bring you within walking distance of it. As a resident, I find public transport crowded and unusable for the week of these concerts. Marlay Park is free for anyone to enjoy except when these concerts take place. I know the concerts bring a lot of enjoyment and employment. However, the park has been taken over by the production company since June 15th with pedestrian pathways cut off and parking limited and this continues until July 11 th. This past week the music has been loud and intrusive particularly during the Longitude Festival which lasts for three days starting at 1.30pm and finishing at 11pm with sound-checks starting at 11am and earlier. How is this suitable for a highly residential area with a considerably older population and also a number of nursing homes? Marlay Park was left by its former owners for the people to enjoy. It was not left for a private company to take over for almost a month and cause considerable disruption to everyone, including public transport users. – Yours, etc, ELAINE BYRNE, Ballinteer, Dublin 16.
