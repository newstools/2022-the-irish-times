Sir, – Jim Deegan (Letters, July 6th), former board member of the National Transport Authority, advocates for an Irish Rail link to Dublin Airport instead of Metrolink. Mr Deegan argues that most of the land required is available as it is sterilised because it is under the flight plan. But this is a good reason why the rail link has been rejected, because it doesn’t and can’t and won’t serve a single house or business! In addition, because the northern line is at capacity, to provide trains for the airport requires reducing the number of Darts serving Malahide and Howth. Mr Deegan is correct that we are the only European capital without a train to the airport. But it is because there are too many people hung up on buses, or a pointless rail link, or fixated on the airport destination only. Metrolink is not just for Dublin Airport, but also DCU and the communities of Glasnevin, Santry, Ballymun, Swords and the north county. None of which would be served by a rail link over sterilised land! The Government needs to stop listening to people providing unviable alternatives and knuckle down and get Metrolink built. – Yours, etc, JASON FITZHARRIS, Rivervalley, Swords, Sir, – It is interesting to review the plans for the St Stephen’s Green station on the proposed new metro (News, July 5th). All the old mature trees on the north of the Green are to be eliminated, and the Fusiliers’ Arch will be moved, but they will be replaced by a nice plastic station entrance. The Green, or what’s left of it, will be returned to the people of Dublin (the rightful owners) after the metro construction site is removed. So much for the greening of Dublin and our so-called Green Party. I am in favour of the metro but not at the cost of destroying St Stephen’s Green. Alternative locations can be found for the proposed station and construction site. – Yours, etc, JIM COFFEY, Dalkey, Co Dublin.
