Eir customers are facing annual price hikes as part of a new strategy that will see prices rise by 3 per cent plus inflation. The regular price increases will come into effect from next April, with Eir applying the inflation rate from January of each year. The operator said the move was due to higher operating costs, and would support further investment in the network. “This annual automated increase is being applied to assist with increased operating costs, supporting further investment, while removing the ambiguity of price increases for customers and ensuring price corresponds with inflation rates,” Eir said. The news came as the company said it would implement higher prices for customers of its fixed voice plans, broadband, TV and mobile services from August. Around 25 per cent of customers would be impacted by the move, Eir said, which would add €5 per month to current customers’ bills. Customers will be notified in writing, Eir said, and customers would be able to opt out of their contract.
