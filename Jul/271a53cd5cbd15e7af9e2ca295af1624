Drinks group C&C said its trading performance was “solid” in the four months to June 30th, with net revenues ahead of pre-Covid levels as the company enters its traditionally busier of the summer period. But the Bulmers cidermaker also warned that inflation posed a challenge to future demand, saying it was “vigilant” on the potential impact on its cost base and consumer pressures. C&C said it was managing its costs but did not rule out future price increases during the fiscal year. C&C said revenues were up 6 per cent for the period between March 1st and June 30th. The company will also hold its annual general meeting later today. Chairman Stewart Gilliland is not seeking re-election, stepping down after four years in the role and 10 years on the board. He will be succeeded by Ralph Findlay, subject to shareholder approval. “I would like thank Stewart for his commitment and stewardship of C&C, during which time the Group has transformed into the leading final-mile distributor to the on-trade in the UK and Ireland, while navigating the business through the most challenging period in our industry’s history,” Mr Findlay said. “The group has iconic brands, a leading distribution network and a strong capital structure to sustain its future growth ambitions. I look forward to playing a role in driving the future success of the business for all our stakeholders including customers, consumers, employees and shareholders.”
