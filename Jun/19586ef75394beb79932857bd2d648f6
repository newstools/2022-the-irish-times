Sir, – We’ve just had a very tragic weekend with several fatalities on the country’s roads. Fuel prices are now also at an all time high. Following the draw for the All-Ireland Football qualifiers GAA fans were looking forward to supporting their teams in nearby neutral venues. One would have thought that the Roscommon v Clare match would have been held in Salthill, Galway with supporters travelling on average 90km taking just over an hour to reach the venue. The GAA has scheduled it instead for Croke Park which means supporters must travel on average 200km taking over 2½ hours. In a similar vein, one would have thought the Mayo v Kildare match would have been held in either Tullamore or Roscommon. With it being held in Croke Park, Mayo supporters now face an average three-hour journey and a 250km trip. The timing of this match is also noteworthy: kick-off is 6pm just 15 minutes before the last train to Mayo departs from Heuston Station. The logic behind the scheduling of these matches by the GAA beggars belief. Supporters will have to spend several hours on round trips to Croke Park and spend an amount of money on fuel. Instead of matches being played in sold-out provincial venues they will instead be played in a three-quarters empty Croke Park. Safe journey to all those travelling next Saturday – unfortunately I won’t be one of them. – Yours, etc, VAL BAYNES, Ballina, Co Mayo.
