Tottenham Hotspur defender Matt Doherty will miss the rest of the campaign after suffering a knee injury in Saturday’s 4-0 Premier League win at Aston Villa, Sky Sports reported. Doherty was taken off in the 21st minute following a tackle by Villa’s Matty Cash. Sky Sports said on Monday that the 30-year-old is expected to be out for 12 weeks. Such a time frame would also likely rule him out of Ireland's Nations League fixtures in June. The Ireland international has bagged four assists and two goals in 15 league games this season for Spurs, who are fourth on 57 points after 31 matches. Doherty has become a major part of Stephen Kenny’s Ireland side of late, playing in both of the recent friendlies against Belgium and Lituania.
