Sir, – This week’s ESRI report draws welcome attention to the psychological impact of the pandemic (“Depression rates in young rose in pandemic”, News, June 20th). The online survey of 22-year-olds found that, in December 2020, 41 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women had clinically significant distress. This was not necessarily clinical depression but was, understandably, higher than rates of distress before the pandemic (22 per cent of men and 31 per cent of women). Globally, one person in five struggled significantly with stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms during Covid. This was higher in certain groups, such as healthcare workers. The ESRI study found that “being involved in team sports before the pandemic and confiding in a boy/girlfriend” were protective factors for men. For women, “supportive peer relationships and positive family relationships helped”. It is vital that we provide mental healthcare to those who need it, but it would be a mistake to over-medicalise human distress. This study shows just how closely distress was linked with circumstances over the past few years. Despite everything, suicide fell in some countries, such as the US in 2020. Even one suicide is one too many, but positive change is possible. Covid highlighted our fragilities, but it also showed that we are stronger, wiser and kinder than we think. – Yours, etc, BRENDAN KELLY, Professor of Psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2.
