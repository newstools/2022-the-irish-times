Johann van Graan has made eight changes from the Munster side which recorded a significant win away to Ulster last week for Friday night’s vital URC clash against Cardiff at Musgrave Park (7.35pm, live on Premier Sports and TG4). Simon Zebo returns to the side for Munster’s last game of the season in his native city a week after he and fiancée Elvira Fernandez welcomed their fourth child, Isabella. Conor Murray and Ben Healy are also restored at half-back, with Rory Scannell starting at inside centre and Calvin Nash on the right wing. Up front John Ryan returns at tight-head, with Thomas Ahern set to start after illness relegated him to the bench last week, while the fit again Peter O’Mahony is recalled to lead the side. Academy hooker Scott Buckley is among the replacements and in line to make his seventh appearance of the campaign and flanker Jack Daly is set for his first appearance since January after a spell on the sidelines with injury. Munster sit third in the table a point behind the Stormers but have the next five teams within three points of them as they head into the penultimate round of the regular URC season, and it is a measure of the game’s importance that the Ireland international trio Craig Casey, Joey Carbery and Shane Daly are all named on the bench. Munster: Mike Haley; Calvin Nash, Chris Farrell, Rory Scannell, Simon Zebo; Ben Healy, Conor Murray; Jeremy Loughman, Diarmuid Barron, John Ryan; Jean Kleyn, Thomas Ahern; Peter O’Mahony (C), Alex Kendellen, Jack O’Donoghue. Replacements: Scott Buckley, Josh Wycherley, Keynan Knox, Jason Jenkins, Jack Daly, Craig Casey, Joey Carbery, Shane Daly.
