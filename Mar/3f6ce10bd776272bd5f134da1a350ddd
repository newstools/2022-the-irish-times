Bord Bia has announced that its chief executive officer Tara McCarthy is to step down from her role later this year. Ms McCarthy will take up a new position in the private sector in June. Bord Bia chairman Dan MacSweeney said: “On behalf of the Board of Bord Bia, I wish Tara the very best for the future and thank her for her tremendous efforts on behalf of Bord Bia and for her dedication and commitment to our client companies and the food, drink, and horticulture sector. “Tara has made a significant contribution to Bord Bia, and the organisation is in a very good place due to her leadership, energy, and drive over the last five years. “The search for a successor to Tara begins immediately and, in the interim, I have full confidence in the leadership team in Bord Bia to continue to successfully execute our new and exciting strategy.” Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said Ms McCarthy “guided the organisation and supported the industry through many challenges, including the impacts of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic”. “Tara has nurtured top talent, as well as building Ireland’s voice in thought leadership on sustainability, with benefits for the sector as a whole,” he said. “Tara has focused on developing new markets while building on existing ones to the benefit of our world-class primary producers, farm families and fishers.”
