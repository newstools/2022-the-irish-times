Salesforce software provider Gearset is to open a new office in Belfast next month, creating an additional 10 jobs by the end of the year. The UK-based software development company currently employs 137 people at its offices in Cambridge and the recently opened office in Chicago. It plans to build a team of 15 engineers in Belfast, starting with five software engineers and adding the remaining 10 by the end of 2022. “In looking to expand our development capacity, Gearset has recognised an amazing calibre of engineering talent in the Belfast tech ecosystem, and we can’t wait to work with more like-minded engineers who are as passionate about software development as we are,” said Luke Drury, head of engineering at Gearset. The new office will be led by Eamonn Boyle, who has more than 15 years experience as a software engineer and trainer for Belfast-based software companies. “ We’re confident that Eamonn will bring the right blend of leadership, enthusiasm and software development experience needed to attract and retain the top talent we need to continue our rapid growth and deliver great customer experiences within the Salesforce DevOps market,” said Mr Drury.
