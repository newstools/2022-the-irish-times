Sir, – According to the latest Wikipedia entry on Stephen Kenny online, which covers events up to June 8th of this year, he has consecutively managed the Ireland soccer team for 24 matches. His record is: won five, lost nine, drew 10. The percentage winning rate is just under 21 per cent. If he were managing an English league team, he would, according to the points system used therein, have amassed 25 points out of a possible 72. Could someone explain why he is still in situ as Ireland manager on a salary of over half a million a year: his latest achievements in the Europa Nations League confirming the mediocrity of the Irish soccer team under his management, with two 1-0 defeats? Can someone – anyone – justify his retention by the FAI? – Yours, etc, BRIAN COSGROVE, Cornelscourt, Dublin 18. Sir, – Ireland running round in circles. Steepest learning curve since Euclid. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL KEEGAN, Booterstown, Co Dublin. Sir, – I watched the Ireland Ukraine football match last night and it always saddens me that many of the players on our Irish teams do not sing the National Anthem. The same applies at rugby matches. Other teams are so proud to sing their anthem, with hands on heart and clearly singing every word of their National Anthem; however, many of the Irish players are chewing gum or just standing there silent. I think every player should be required to sing the anthem — it shows disrespect to their country if they don’t. – Yours, etc, CLAIRE O’REILLY, Booterstown, Co Dublin.
