Former Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette has rejoined Lyon on a three-year deal. The 31-year-old former France international was a free agent after seeing out his contract with the Premier League club, which officially expires on June 30th. Ligue 1 side Lyon confirmed on Thursday morning that they had resigned the player they sold to the Gunners in 2017. A club statement read: “Olympique Lyonnais are very proud and very happy to announce the return to the club of Alexandre Lacazette, a product of the club’s academy, for the next three seasons.

At the time of his move to London, he had won 11 senior caps for France and has since made a further five appearances. Lacazette scored six goals and made eight assists in 36 appearances for Arsenal during the 2021-22 season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, just missing out on a Champions League place.
