Sir, – The disparity in pay for consultants appointed after 2012 is set to grow even larger with reversal of Fempi cuts for more senior medics (News, June 21st). The public salaries for pre-2012 consultants will now be 30 to 50 per cent higher than for more recent appointees doing the same work. Nothing approaching an equivalent situation is seen across the public service. Would it be acceptable if 40 per cent of judicial, teaching or Civil Service positions were vacant while new appointees, more likely to be female or from outside Ireland, were being asked to work under such pay discrimination? There should be no surprise that we are approaching 1,000 vacant consultant posts. What seems remarkable is that industrial action has yet to take place. – Yours, etc, STEVEN MALONEY, Dublin 6.
