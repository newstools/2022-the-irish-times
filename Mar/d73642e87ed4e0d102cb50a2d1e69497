Alasdair Henderson has been appointed as executive director of construction company Bam Contractors, effective immediately. His appointment comes just days after the company announced Theo Cullinane is to retire from his role as chief executive of the business. Mr Cullinane, who has led the company for the past 13 years, is to step down in June. A chartered engineer, Mr Henderson has spent 26 years at Royal Bam serving in a number of senior roles. ‘In Alasdair we have appointed someone who has a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the construction industry over many years. Not only is he someone who wants to get close to the people, but he has the operational understanding which I know will help us continue to grow our business in Ireland, working closely with his colleagues in the rest of our UK and Ireland division,” said Ruud Joosten, chief executive of Royal Bam.
