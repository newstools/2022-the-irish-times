Manchester City have confirmed a deal to sign striker Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer. The striker’s buy-out clause, understood to be about €60 million, has been met and the Norway international will earn a salary of about £350,000 (€409,000) a week, plus bonuses. Haaland passed a medical this week and the deal ends Pep Guardiola’s search for a long-term successor to City’s record goalscorer, Sergio Agüero. Haaland, who will be 22 in July, has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for Dortmund, whom he joined from RB Salzburg in January 2020. City said: “Manchester City can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle with Borussia Dortmund for the transfer of striker Erling Haaland to the club on 1st July 2022. The transfer remains subject to the club finalising terms with the player.” Guardiola had earlier cautioned against the idea that Haaland will solve all City’s goalscoring needs. “The new players always help to try to be a stronger team but a good defender will not solve our defensive problems, one striker will not solve scoring problems that maybe we have,” the manager said. “Not me, the club has to have a vision for the future. I am always completely aware and supportive 100 per cent.” – Guardian
