An Bord Pleanála has cleared the way for Indaver Ireland’s incinerator facility at Duleek in Co Meath to increase the amount of waste it receives to 280,000 tonnes per year. Prior to making the application Indaver Ireland Ltd was licensed to accept 235,000 tonnes per year. The facility can now accept an additional 15,000 tonnes of waste which can be hazardous for treatment, and up to an additional 30,000 tonnes of third-party boiler ash and flue gas clearing residues and other residues for pre-treatment. The board concluded that the scheme would not have an unacceptable impact on the environment, and would not seriously injure the visual or residential amenities of the area. One of those to object was local Sinn Féin TD Darren O’Rourke. Mr O’Rourke told the appeals board that an over-intensification of heavy industry in the area would have negative implications for residents. The board inspector in the case concluded that the proposal will make a significant contribution towards the provision of additional thermal recovery capacity for hazardous waste. The most recent accounts for Indaver Ireland show that it recorded pre-tax profits of €9.35 million in 2020 as revenues increased to €81.94 million. The facility employs 191.
