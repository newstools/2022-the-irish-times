Sir, – I was shocked to read that Ryanair is protecting itself from false passports by acting as an immigration authority for South Africa (“Ryanair requires South Africans to prove nationality with Afrikaans test”, June 6th). How can Ryanair believe that Afrikaans, used by 10 per cent of people in South Africa, is spoken by a majority. The inference [underpinning the airline’s actions] has to be that [it considers] black South Africans are more likely than white people to travel on a fake passport. If such a requirement was applied to Irish citizens, how many of us could successfully complete such a form in our so-called first language never mind a minority one such as Ukrainian for instance. Get real Ryanair. – Yours, etc, MARION WALSH, Donnybrook, Dublin 4.
