At least 56 people were killed in landslides and floods triggered by the first typhoon that hit the Philippines this year, as authorities search mounds of mud for dozens more who are missing. In Baybay City in Leyte province, 47 people died in mudslides caused by Typhoon Megi, while 105 more were hurt and 27 missing, officials said. Photos posted on the city government’s Facebook page showed houses buried in mud, with backhoes and trucks deployed for search and retrieval efforts. A state of calamity has been declared in the area to hasten rescue and relief. Nearly 140,000 people have been affected by the storm locally known as Agaton, which first made landfall over Eastern Samar province on April 10th, the nation’s disaster risk-reduction and management council said on Tuesday. Megi has already dissipated, but another storm which had also exited Philippine territory, will still bring rough seas in the country’s eastern portions, the weather bureau said. Megi is this year’s first tropical storm to hit the Philippines where about 20 cyclones pass through annually. In 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,300 people in the Southeast Asian nation, mostly in eastern Visayas which includes Leyte and Samar. – Bloomberg
