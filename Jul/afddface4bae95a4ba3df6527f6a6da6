International building services engineering consultancy Norman Disney & Young is to expand its Irish operations, adding up to 20 staff in Dublin. The company, which recently began operations in Ireland, is building its technical and leadership team, recruiting engineers in disciplines such as mechanical, electrical sustainability and digital engineering. The Irish operation is focused on securing landmark projects throughout Europe, using local engineering expertise. “Along with driving the uptake of smart buildings technologies, we are helping our clients in Ireland and Europe to be world leaders in decarbonisation of their buildings,” said NDY’s Dublin-based regional director, Mike Arnold. “We need to bring the best local expertise to support their ambitions.” NDY is part of the Tetra Tech High Performance Buildings Group, which has more than 2,000 expert technical staff worldwide, with operations in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Europe and North America. The news was welcomed by Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Leo Varadkar. “With the focus of this new venture being on Europe, it highlights Ireland’s EU membership and location as a hugely important factor when attracting FDI to our shores,” he said. “These new jobs will provide an exciting opportunity for some of our highly skilled engineering graduates, who will become part of Norman Disney & Young’s worldwide operations.” The expansion is being supported by IDA Ireland.
