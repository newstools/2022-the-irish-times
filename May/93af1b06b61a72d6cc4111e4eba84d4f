Commercial real-estate adviser HWBC has established a new division to provide capital markets advice. The company expects to assist its clients in raising more than €200 million in debt and equity this year to finance both development projects and investment deals. HWBC Capital will advise on deal structuring, financial modelling and secure access to suitable sources of capital from both domestic and international funding partners. The new division is headed up by Joe McWilliams, who co-founded the business. Joe previously ran property consultants Ironduke and prior to that was head of restructuring at Zurich’s Ireland banking division. Deals HWBC Capital has advised on funding for deals worth more than €90 million so far this year, including a €25 million office refinance, a €20 million residential development in Clontarf and a €30 million leveraged buyout of a logistics business. Commenting on the new division Mr McWilliams said: “This is an important addition to our offering at HWBC. The market has changed in that there are now substantial debt funds available, in part replacing traditional lenders. There is also a substantial wall of risk equity available to co-invest in projects with existing owners and platforms. “Following a slowdown in deal flow during Covid the market is back with a bang and we are expecting a busy year advising on over €200 million of finance deals.”
