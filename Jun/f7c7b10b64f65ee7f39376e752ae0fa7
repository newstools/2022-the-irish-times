Sir, – I note it is reported (News, June 29th) that there may be up to 4.5 million surplus vaccines that may not be used and that the Department of Health is exploring a number of options to avoid wastage, including delaying further deliveries of the vaccine. At present, on age grounds, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is only recommending a second booster for individuals aged 65 and over. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending a second booster for individuals aged 50 and over. With waning immunity in the community, and to avoid wastage, a second booster should now be offered to the 50 to 64 age cohort, notwithstanding the absence of a recommendation from Niac. – Yours, etc, PAUL WALSH, Skerries, Co Dublin. Sir, – Instead of wasting vaccine doses, why not allow anyone who wants one to obtain a second booster? – Yours, etc, RICHARD BANNISTER, Kildare, Co Kildare.
