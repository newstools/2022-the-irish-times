Munster’s South African forward Jason Jenkins will be moving to Leinster at the end of this season, the province has announced. The lock cum backrow has only played once for Munster this season due to injury but is widely believed to have been signed to add power to Leinster’s secondrow. It is a position that the province could potentially be light in at the end of the current campaign with Jack Dunne and Charlie Ryan likely to leave according to reports, while Devin Toner is out of contract. Jenkins has been capped by the Springboks and had stints with the Bulls and Toyota Verblitz in Japan before moving to Munster. Leo Cullen welcomed the new addition upon Jenkins’ unveiling: “We understand how unfortunate Jason has been with injuries since his arrival in Ireland but everyone can also see what he brings to the table in terms of his physicality, his size and his skillset and we look forward to welcoming him to Leinster Rugby ahead of next season. “I know from talking to him that he is looking forward to the challenge and putting his hand up for selection in a competitive group of players. “It’s been a very positive week or so for us on the contracting front and we are always looking to bolster the talent we have nurtured from the ground up with players from abroad. When you consider the addition of the four South African teams to the United Rugby Championship we believe that Jason is the right profile for us and that he will also add hugely from his experiences in other environments.”
