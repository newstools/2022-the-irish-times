You might say that crypto currencies have been on a rollercoaster ride over recent months but only if the rollercoaster you were thinking about had a peculiarly and uniquely downward trajectory. Less than six months ago the value of the virtual currencies that have turned the heads financial wizards, big business, criminals and — increasingly — small scale and mostly young investors all over the word was put at an astonishing three trillion dollars. That’s a three with 12 zeros after it. Today, the value of the world’s cryptocurrency market is less than one trillion dollars and the smart money is not betting on a recovery any time soon. But what is behind the collapse and is it just another dip in a volatile virtual currency or is digital money is a death spiral? Brian Lucey is an economics professor in Trinity College and he has been following the evolution of crypto assets since they were born just a few years ago. He talks to In The News about the rise and fall, and fall and fall of virtual money and pores of the runes — or should that be ruins — to see what might come next.
