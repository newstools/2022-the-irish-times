Rónan Kelleher has flown home from Leinster’s tour of South Africa to be further assessed for a shoulder injury. The Ireland hooker was due to start Leinster’s defeat to the Sharks on Saturday but was withdrawn from the lineup as a precaution. The club have said that his injury is ‘minor’. Kelleher had just returned from a shoulder issue sustained against France on February 12th, playing for the first time since then during the Good Friday demolition of Connacht at the Aviva Stadium. The province also issued an update on Ryan Baird who has not played since Ireland’s Six Nations win against Italy because of a back issue. He is due to step up his rehab at Leinster’s base in UCD, though it remains unclear if he will be fit for the Champions Cup quarter-final against Leicester on May 7th. Max Deegan and James Tracy, who picked up shoulder and neck problems respectively in South Africa, are to be assessed further before their availability for this weekend’s fixture against the Stormers in Cape Town is decided.
