A 38-year-old woman has gone on trial for the alleged murder of a two-year old girl in an apartment in Cork city almost three years ago. Karen Harrington with an address at Lakelands Crescent, Mahon in Cork has denied the murder of Santina Cawley at Elderwood Park, Boreenamanna Road, Cork on July 5th, 2019. Santina Cawley was found with serious injuries at an apartment in Elderwood Park on the day in question and taken to Cork University Hospital where she was later pronounced dead. On Monday at the Central Criminal Court sitting at the Anglesea Street Courthouse in Cork, Ms Harrington replied “not guilty” when she was arraigned on the charge that she murdered Santina Cawley. Mr Justice Michael McGrath told the jury of seven men and five women that the trial would last at least three weeks and most likely four weeks, with a slight chance it might extend into a fifth week.
