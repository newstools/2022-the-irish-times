Professional services company Aon has announced a new head for its Irish business, with Rachael Ingle stepping into the newly created role of chief executive of Aon Ireland. The change to its local leadership team here is designed to support the delivery of the firm’s plan to bring business divisions together to deliver value to clients and drive sustainable growth. Ms Ingle, who joined Aon in 1998, previously oversaw the retirement and investment business for Aon in Ireland. She will now oversee the acceleration of the Aon growth strategy, and also head up Aon’s Wealth Solutions business in the EMEA region and act as sub-region leader for the Nordics. “In a world that is more volatile and fast-moving than ever before, the risks facing leaders are becoming more complex and the need for better decisions has never been greater,” said Ms Ingle. “With growing impact of geopolitical risk on businesses, as well as the need to address other forms of risk such as climate change and rising costs, Aon is committed to helping organisations to not only protect their business but help it to grow and thrive.” Aon has four main solution lines in Ireland – commercial risk solutions, health solutions, wealth solutions and human capital solutions – and five shared service functions. It has more than 100 years of heritage in Ireland, and employs more than 700 people.
