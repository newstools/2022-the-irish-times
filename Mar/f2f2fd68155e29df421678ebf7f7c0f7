Connacht have announced the signing of Irish-qualified back Byron Ralston from the Western Force. The Australian U20 international plays predominantly at wing or centre. Ralston has made 14 Super Rugby appearances and has scored five tries to date. The 21 year old will make the move to Galway ahead of next season. This is the second signing Connacht have made from the southern hempisphere in recent days following the announcement of Kiwi backrow Shamus Hurley-Langton’s impending move. Speaking about his new club, Ralston pointed to the style of Connacht’s game being a good fit. “Moving to Connacht Rugby and the west of Ireland is a brilliant opportunity for me” he said. “ The style of rugby that they play will suit me down to the ground, and it gives me a chance to reconnect with my Irish roots.” “ I’m obviously aware of the positive experience other Aussies have had after moving to Connacht, and so I will be doing all I can to make a similar impact and help the club achieve the level of success they are all working towards.”
