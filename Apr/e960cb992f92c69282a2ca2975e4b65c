Ryanair says a deal with fuel supplier Neste will cut greenhouse gas emissions from some of its Amsterdam flights by more than 60 per cent. The Irish airline will power one-third of its flights from Schiphol Airport with a 40 per cent blend of Finland-based Neste’s sustainable aviation fuel. Ryanair calculates that the move will cut greenhouse gas emissions from the flights involved by more than 60 per cent. The move follows last year’s pledge to back the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre in Trinity College Dublin. Ryanair’s director of sustainability, Thomas Fowler, said the use of sustainable aviation fuel – an alternative to the kerosene used in jets – was a cornerstone of the airline’s plan to reach net zero carbon by 2050. “We look forward to growing our partnership with Neste as we work toward achieving our goal of operating 12.5 per cent of Ryanair flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030,” he added. Jonathan Wood, Neste’s vice-president Europe, noted that the EU planned to promote sustainable aviation fuels’ use. He added that Ryanair was the first short-haul airline to begin using its sustainable aviation fuel at Amsterdam. Neste has a sustainable fuel production plant at Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
