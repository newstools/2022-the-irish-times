Sligo Rovers 3 Finn Harps 0 (Keena 3, 86, O’Sullivan 7) Karl O’Sullivan and Aidan Keena tormented Finn Harps as Sligo Rovers claimed the bragging rights in the northwest derby at the Showgrounds. Former Harps winger O’Sullivan scored one and was involved in both of Keena’s two goals, as the Bit O’ Red picked up their second home win under the watch of new boss John Russell. Keena had the ball in the net inside three minutes, as he finished from close range after O’Sullivan’s cross was deflected into his path. The striker got his second of the night and his fifth goal in two games against Finn Harps at the Showgrounds this season, when he fired home in the closing stages to wrap up the win. Again O’Sullivan was the driving force, crossing superbly for the striker to confidently fire home with four minutes left. Before that, O’Sullivan had doubled the home side’s advantage with another early strike, finishing to the net after the Harps defence failed to deal with a long ball forward from Shane Blaney. Ollie Horgan’s side were competitive despite the scoreline, but rarely threatened Ed McGinty in the Sligo goal, though Eric McWoods had a good chance foiled by the netminder in the opening half. Sligo Rovers: McGinty, Banks, Buckley (Pijnaker ht), Blaney, Kirk, Cawley (Barlow 81), Morahan, O’Sullivan, Fitzgerald, Keena, Mata (Keogh 68). Finn Harps: McGinley, Boyle, Carrillo, Slevin, Tourish, Donelon (Timlin 79), Mahdy (Duncan ht), McNamee, McWoods, Rainey, Mihaljevic (Rudden 82). Referee: D MacGraith.
