Despite failing to pick up a win, Fermanagh produced the performance of the weekend in the Nicky Rackard Cup as they kept things incredibly competitive against a Donegal side that hurled two divisions up from them in this year’s league, before losing out by 1-21 to 2-13. Donegal had the greater spread of scorers in the opening half as Davin Flynn pointed three frees while Ronan McDermott, Declan Coulter, Daire Ó Maoiléidigh, Conor Gartland, Jack O’Loughlin and Gerry Gilmore all found the target. However, they couldn’t shake off a stubborn Fermanagh outfit with the sides deadlocked at 0-9 apiece at half-time. Donegal found the breakthrough when Ronan McDermott goaled. Fermanagh refused to wilt under pressure as a Brian Teehan goal pulled them back to within a point. Donegal fired over the next two scores, a Barney McAuley penalty levelled the game, but Daire Flynn and Daire Ó Maoiléidigh hit the points that clinched the win for Donegal. Tyrone beat Warwickshire 7-18 to 2-11 as they sent out a statement of intent. Five goals in the opening half ensured Tyrone would not be caught, Rúairí Slane and Tiernan Murphy both finding the net twice with CJ McGourty adding another just before half time. Damian Casey goaled for Tyrone with Luke Hands adding both majors for Warwickshire. A late Rory Weir goal helped Tyrone secure an emphatic win. Perhaps the most surprising result was in the Athletic Grounds where Roscommon, who played out two incredibly tight games against Armagh in the league, prevailed by 5-19 to 2-7 against an Armagh side that finished with 13 men on the field. Brendan Mulry hit the opening goal before Mickey Joe Egan flicked a long delivery to the net. Dan Glynn was accurate from frees as Egan landed a second goal to help Roscommon lead by 17 at half-time. Connell Kennelly and Eoin Kieran goaled in the second half while Tiarnan Nevin and Shaun Toll both saw red for Armagh.
