Manchester United are set to announce Erik ten Hag as their new permanent manager once the terms of his €2m release clause from Ajax are finalised in the coming days. Negotiations over the length of the Dutchman’s deal are continuing as United close in on appointing a successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjær, with Ten Hag expected to commit either to an initial three years plus the option of another 12 months or a four-year contract lasting until 2026. It is understood that Ten Hag has been granted a key demand: to be allowed the final decision on transfers together with the club executive due to his determination that the mistakes in the market that have marred the nine years of the post-Sir AlexFerguson era should not be repeated. While official confirmation should not come until after United’s match at Liverpool on Tuesday evening, the current Ajax coach is expected to hold talks over bringing his number two at the Dutch club, Mitchell Van der Gaag, to be his assistant while discussions regarding Steve McClaren also forming part of his backroom staff continue. United, who wish to be respectful of Ajax, will be in direct contact this week regarding Ten Hag’s release clause. Ajax were beaten 2-1 by PSV Eindhoven in the KNVB Cup final on Sunday. Once the payment details of this are agreed, his confirmation as United’s fifth manager in less than a decade since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to be confirmed. - Guardian
