Question: My 14-year-old son is really worried that world war three will break out. Since Russia invaded Ukraine he has been anxious. He is not sleeping well as a result and is tired and on edge during the day. I try to reassure him that things won’t go that far, but he argues back with me. He asks how could I possibly know that. He follows the news and is well informed and he has always liked history (unfortunately, about the second World War, the Cold War, etc). I find I don’t know what to say to help him. To be honest, I have also been very disturbed by recent events. I find the images of war appalling and, like my son, I am worried too, so I imagine this is not helping either. I grew up as a child with my own fears of nuclear war during the Cold War so it is heart breaking to see him now worried like me a generation later. Answer: You and your son are not alone. The breakout of war has been traumatic and disturbing for the whole world. The fact that it is so near to us in Europe and with the prospect of a sustained conflict and possible escalation with nuclear weapons in the background, it is a terrifying set of events. Further, we are all witnessing the harrowing suffering of the war in real time on social media and in the constant 24-hour news cycle. Aside from the fear of what might happen next, helplessly witnessing the mass suffering of others can be deeply traumatising. Here are a couple of ideas as to how you can help yourself and your son cope emotionally. Seek some support for yourself It is good that you have noticed how your own feelings have been triggered and that you are aware of how your fears resonate with what you experienced as a child. Find a place where you can talk about and express your own feelings and worries. This could simply mean confiding in your partner or arranging to meet an empathic friend to discuss things. The more you are able to express, process and understand your own feelings, the more able you will be to help your son.
