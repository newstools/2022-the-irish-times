US marketing and business outsourcing firm MarketStar is to create 300 jobs in Dublin. The new roles will be filled over the next three years and will bring the company’s employment footprint here to 500. The Utah-headquartered company said it had secured a new building in the Central Park complex in Leopardstown for its new Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) headquarters. “Establishing Dublin as our EMEA headquarters marks an exciting milestone in our overall growth strategy, solidifying our commitment to the European market and strengthening our global sales capabilities,” said Keith Titus, president and chief executive of MarketStar. “We will continue to thoughtfully expand our global footprint, and this new Central Park facility enables MarketStar to work from a position of strength in the European market to enable growth for our clients and employees.” MarketStar has been in Ireland since 2019 when it purchased Irish inside sales agency Product2Market. Since that time, MarketStar has doubled the number of jobs and revenue based in Dublin. The company joins world-leading brands like SalesForce, Bank of America, Mastercard, and others in the Leopardstown venue, which also includes apartments, retail space, dining, and lodging. Welcoming the announcement Tánaiste and Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said:“This is fantastic news from MarketStar, I am happy the company has found a home in Dublin’s Central Park for its new EMEA headquarters and will be creating an incredible 300 new jobs over the next three years.” “ It is a remarkable expansion that will bring the company’s total workforce here to 500 by 2025,” he said.
