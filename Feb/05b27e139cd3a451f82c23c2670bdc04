An Bord Pleanála has given the green light to plans for the construction of a €42 million 131-unit residential scheme for Stocking Lane in Ballyboden, Dublin 16. The board has granted permission to MacCabe Durney Barnes Ltd for the Strategic Housing Development scheme despite significant opposition from local residents. Members of South Dublin County Council also expressed concerns over the proposal, which is located within the foothills of the Dublin Mountains and 2.5km from Rathfarnham. Last March, the board rejected plans by MacCabe Durney Barnes for a 131-unit scheme for the same site over the developer’s failure to publish a newspaper planning notice stating that the scheme contravenes the County Development Plan. The company reapplied in October. The scheme is made up of 108 apartments, two duplexes and 21 houses and at a Rathfarnham Area Committee Meeting, councillors argued that the density was excessive while the proposed heights were not acceptable. Requirements Members also expressed concern that the development would result in a transient population. Some of those to object included Ballyboden Tidy Towns Group, Prospect Manor Residents’ Association, and the Springvale Residents’ Association. However, the council executive recommended that permission be granted. The developer in response to its part V social housing requirements is proposing to sell 10 per cent of the units to the council for an indicative €4.2 million, or an average of €323,306 each. The board granted permission after concluding that the scheme would constitute an acceptable residential density at the location, would not seriously injure the residential or visual amenities of the area, and would be acceptable in terms of traffic and pedestrian safety. The inspector in the case, Paul O’Brien, concluded the proposed density at 54 units per hectare was acceptable considering the availability of public transport, the established character of the area and its location close to the M50.
