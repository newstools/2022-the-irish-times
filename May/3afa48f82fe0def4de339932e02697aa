Texas Medical Center (TMC) has formed a strategic partnership with Enterprise Ireland to foster collaboration and help solve global health challenges. The TMC Ireland BioBridge partnership will allow Irish companies, entrepreneurs, researchers, clinicians, and industry partners to collaborate with Texas Medical Center, the world’s largest medical city. The partnership, which was formalised at a ceremony in Dublin, is designed to lead to the improvement of patient health and care through the development of innovative medical devices, digital health solutions, and therapeutics. “The breakthrough technology and entrepreneurship that is coming out of Ireland is truly impressive, and the TMC team is thrilled to be in Ireland today to solidify our partnership,” said William McKeon, president and chief executive of Texas Medical Center. “The past two years has shown the importance of collaboration at a global scale, and we are eager to start our work with Enterprise Ireland’s team to further global innovation and research.” This is the fourth such partnership that TMC has entered into, with global partners including Australia, Denmark and the UK. The news was welcomed by Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar. “Years of investment by Government and industry has created a concentrated community of innovation and expertise within Ireland that is breaking new ground and making a major contribution to international healthcare,” he said. “Today’s announcement by Texas Medical Center and Enterprise Ireland is a very positive development and will drive further integration and opportunities to bring Irish healthcare innovation to the world.”
