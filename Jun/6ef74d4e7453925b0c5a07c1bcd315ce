A male pedestrian is being treated for serious injuries in hospital following a collision with a vehicle on O’Connell Bridge in Dublin city centre. Images from the scene show an articulated truck surrounded by a garda cordon. Gardaí said they are continuing to investgate the incident and that the southbound section of bridge was likely to remain closed for the remainder of Friday afternoon. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area. “Gardaí are currently at the scene of a road traffic collision that occurred on O’Connell Bridge, Dublin this afternoon. A male pedestrian has been taken to hospital with serious injuries,” they said in a statement. A photograph taken from the upper deck of a bus and posted on social media described an articulated truck “cornered” by four garda cars. Another image appeared to show a white truck in the middle section of the road.
