CAOIMHÍN KELLEHER: Did not have a great deal to do, but made an early save from John McGinn and fielded a series of high balls to keep Scotland at bay. Rating: 7 NATHAN COLLINS: Solid at the back and composed with the ball at his feet. Rating: 7 SHANE DUFFY: Hugely effective in the air at both ends of the pitch and played a key role in the opening goal, but picked up a booking which rules him out of Tuesday’s clash with Ukraine. Rating: 7 JOHN EGAN (Capt): Largely untroubled in defence, where he was in uncompromising mood to deny the Scots clearcut opportunities. Rating: 7 ALAN BROWNE: Pressed into service as a right wing back, made more than a fist of limiting the dangerous Andy Robertson and scored the all-important first goal. Rating: 8 JOSH CULLEN: Set the tone in the middle of the field with an industrious display and grew in stature as he game wore on. Rating: 7 JAYSON MOLUMBY: Took time to settle in, but formed a good understanding with Cullen in the engine room. Rating: 7 JAMES McCLEAN: Typically energetic throughout and provided the most inviting set-piece delivery Ireland have enjoyed for some time. Rating: 7 TROY PARROTT: Kept the visitors’ rearguard on their toes with a high-energy display and capped an intelligent run with an assured finish to get his name on the scoresheet. Rating: 7 JASON KNIGHT: Snapped into tackles from the off to put the Scots under pressure and provided an outlet for the whole time he was on the field. Rating: 8 MICHAEL OBAFEMI: Produced a stunning pass to set up Parrott’s goal and an even better finish to cap a display full of pace and power. Rating: 9 Substitutes: Scott Hogan came on for Obafemi after 56 minutes and was unfortunate not to get the benefit of a VAR review on a header hooked off the line by Grant Hanley. Conor Hourihane (71 mins), Jeff Hendrick (84 mins) and Callum Robinson (84 mins) added fresh legs late on. Rating: 6
