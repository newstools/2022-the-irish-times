Budget airline Ryanair has announced a new service from Shannon to Marseille in the south of France. The service will operate twice weekly, each Wednesday and Saturday, commencing May 4th. It will depart from Shannon at 4pm on Wednesdays and arrive in Marseille at 7.25pm. It will depart Shannon on Saturdays at 8.45am and arrive in Marseille at 12.10pm. Shannon Group chief executive Mary Considine said: “This is really positive news for Shannon Airport. Having connectivity to France is another win for the region. “A service to Marseille from Shannon is fantastic for our passengers, bringing them directly to the southern coast of France near Toulon, St Tropez, Cannes, Monaco and more. “We know that restoring connectivity is important to our airport customers and that is why we have been working hard with our airline partners to create exciting holiday opportunities, like this one. “The addition of Marseille means that Shannon Airport will now connect our passengers to 22 destinations with Ryanair.” Ryanair director of commercial Jason McGuinness said the airline was pleased to add the new route. “Located on the Cote D’Azur, Marseille is the second largest city in France after Paris, is a renowned port city and is the perfect destination for anyone seeking an authentic French city escape,” he said. The new service is part of Ryanair’s summer schedule which will deliver over 67 weekly flights from Shannon Airport to 22 destinations this year. Dr Loïc Guyon, honorary consul of France for the Mid-West region, said the new route was “excellent news” for the region. “The return of an air link between Shannon Airport and France is excellent news for the midwest and Connacht regions both in terms of tourism and in terms of the business opportunities it will notably generate with the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region,” he said.
