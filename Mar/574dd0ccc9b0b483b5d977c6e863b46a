A project aimed at potentially reducing sport-related head injuries has been named best group project at the annual BT Young Scientist business bootcamp. The project investigated sports-related cranial impacts and looked at the development of a wearable device to measure the frequency and strength of head-ball impacts throughout a soccer training session or match, and reduce the risks of long-term head injury in soccer. Thirty student innovators and future entrepreneurs from schools all over the country took part in the programme, which was held between March 7th and 10th at University College Dublin. The bootcamp, which was established in 2010, is delivered in partnership with Nova UCD and is designed to give students the skills needed to develop their project ideas into viable business ventures. The students, who were all participants in the 58th BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition 2022 including the winners Aditya Joshi and Aditya Kumar, were competing for the titles of “best group” and “best individual”.
