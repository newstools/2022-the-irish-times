Sir, – I put forward again the idea to infill the very shallow mudflats at Clontarf as a polder. It would solve the flooding issue and create land to house tens of thousands of people. No high rise. While marine work was ongoing, work could start on parts of tank farm at Dublin Port now not in use. Radical I know but if we are serious about housing our people and recreating Dublin this new thinking is needed. The river Tolka would flow along what is now the seafront to a weir in a new green park and riverside walk. – Yours, etc, HARRY CROSBIE, Hanover Quay, Dublin 2.
