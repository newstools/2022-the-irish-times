GAA president Larry McCarthy has asked the association to mark International Women’s Day on March 8th by coaches speaking to teams about the need to respect women. The comments were made in the course of his address to annual congress in Bekan, Co Mayo. He told delegates that he had been moved to suggest this by the aftermath of Ashling Murphy’s murder. “The past year for the most part was one of continuous highlights in terms of games and the return of sport. One of the most depressing days was the day that Kilcormac-Killoughey camogie player Ashling Murphy was murdered. The outpouring of grief, sorrow, and anger which her murder generated was staggering. Tributes were rightfully paid to a wonderful young woman, to her talents as a teacher, as a musician and as a camogie player.” According to the president he had been contacted by a woman, whose son is a player. “In the wake of the tragedy, I received a note from a mother whose son is on an under-17 county hurling panel. At the end of training the coach gathered the squad together, mentioned the death of Aisling and asked them to have respect for women and girls. “As the mother rightly pointed out, the 37 lads heard the message, but it was passed on to 37 other people who would have been picking the lads up after training. And it was a simple, uncomplicated message, have respect for girls and women. “As we approach International Women’s Day on March 8th, I am asking coaches, in every GAA club, to take one minute to mention to your team about respecting your female friends. Take a minute to call your buddy out if you don’t think what they are doing is right”. Offaly chair Michael Duignan on behalf of Kilcormac-Killoughey and the county thanked the president “for his kind words”.
