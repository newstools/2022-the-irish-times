A woman killed in Dublin on Tuesday is understood to have been stabbed up to 12 times. Lisa Thompson, who was aged in her 50s, was fatally injured at a house in Sandyhill Gardens, in the north Dublin suburb of Ballymun, on Tuesday afternoon. The scene was sealed off for forensic examination. The victim’s remains were initially left in situ pending the arrival of a pathologist before being removed to the City Morgue at Whitehall. Garda sources told The Irish Times the investigation was still in its infancy on Tuesday evening, and that it could take some time before fuller details were established. However, gardaí believe the woman died a violent death. No arrests had been made in the hours afterwards but all the resources of a homicide investigation were committed by gardaí in Ballymun. Neighbours gathered outside their homes, close to two entrance ways to the estate, each cordoned off by Garda tape. A number of them said the victim was a mother of two children, and described hearing sirens sometime at about 3pm as the emergency services arrived into the small estate. The house at which the incident took place, a two-storey property at one end of a 10-home terrace, had blinds drawn in each window. Sympathy Residents expressed sympathy for the deceased, but few in the areas around Sandyhill Gardens appeared to know her well. A woman in a nearby driveway, said she had been near to the house at the time, visiting a friend. “It’s so sad. She has two kids as well, I think a boy and a girl,” she said. Another woman said her daughter had returned home from school earlier that day, passing close to the scene, but had not noticed any commotion. Many people passing by claimed crime was rising in the area, while others offered a more favourable view. “My daughter’s friend lives around here on the road and they never had any trouble with it,” said Bernie Hayes, who passed the scene on her way to visit a friend.
