Ireland’s Séamus Power is almost certain to make his Masters debut in a fortnight’s time after thrashing world number four Patrick Cantlay the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Championship. Power led the American from the first hole in Austin, Texas, before clinching a 5&4 victory on the 14th. Power, who beat Sungjae Im by the same score on Wednesday, began the week ranked 48th in the world and needs to remain in the top 50 on Sunday evening to secure an invite to Augusta National. Shane Lowry is on course to defeat Erik van Rooyen in his match as he stands three up through 12.
