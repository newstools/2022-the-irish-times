Gardaí are keeping an open mind on the motive for a violent attack in Cork city which has left a man in a critical condition in hospital after he was beaten repeatedly around the head with a hammer. The man, who is in his late 20s, was attacked by an intruder at the house he shares with his mother at McCurtain Villas off College Road on the city’s southside at about 4pm on Saturday. It is understood the victim was struck several times around the head by the intruder who also attacked the man’s mother, who is in her 60s, when she tried to intervene to protect her son. The young man was rushed by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where he had emergency surgery for serious head injuries and he was in a critical condition on Saturday night. The man’s mother was also taken by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where she was treated for a number of injuries which are understood to be serious but non-life threatening. Gardaí cordoned off the scene of the attack and Garda technical experts began a forensic examination in the hope of recovering DNA evidence that would help them identify the attacker. Officers also appealed to anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the McCurtain Villas, Wycherley Terrace, College Road or Bandon Road between 3.30pm and 4.30pm to contact them. They have also begun harvesting CCTV footage from the McCurtain Villas area and adjacent streets in a bid to try and identify the culprit whom it’s believed was masked at the time of the attack. They also appealed to any motorists who were in the McCurtain Villages, College Road, Bandon Road or Gillabbey Street area at the time and have dash-cam footage to contact them. Anyone with any information that can assist gardaí is asked to contact Anglesea Garda station on 021 452 2000, the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda station.
