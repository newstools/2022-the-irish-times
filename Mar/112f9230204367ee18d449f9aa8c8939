Cork-based outsourcing company Zevas Communications is to create an additional 50 jobs at a new hub in Mitchelstown. The company, which already employs over 150 people in Cork, Dublin and Waterford, has announced plans to expand into northeast Cork. The new jobs are in sales and customer service. Providing support in over 20 languages, Zevas helps its clients to access new markets and territories. Its first successful hub was unveiled in 2020 in Dungarvan, Co Waterford. Zevas chief operating officer John O’Sullivan said Mitchelstown is “an ideal location” with “a vibrant and skilled workforce within its hinterland, and as we expand is perfectly positioned to attract and accommodate more”. He added: “We were particularly impressed with the site we found here in Mitchelstown. It is state of the art and required very little work to get it up and running. That’s why we have started recruiting already. “Even though all restrictions have been lifted, we will continue to offer our hybrid model for staff. That said, we are ready for staff to enter and work from the Mitchelstown hub immediately.”
