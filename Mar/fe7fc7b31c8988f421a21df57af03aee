Agent Lisney is seeking offers in excess of €950,000 for a 2.1 acre site with residential potential at Citywest in Dublin. Situated on the Blessington Road, the lands are accessible from the existing and well-established Corbally Park residential estate and within close proximity to the full range of transport, retail and recreational amenities at Citywest itself. The subject site is zoned N-Residential under the draft South Dublin County Council development plan 2021-2027. While Citywest Business Campus has a long-established track record as a highly sought after location for both domestic and international employers, the wider Citywest area has also proven to be hugely popular with first-time home buyer and renters. Citywest is situated about 15km south west of Dublin city centre and is served by a range of public transport options, including the Luas red line and numerous Dublin Bus routes which operate a frequent service in the area. Commenting on the sale, Ryan Connell of Lisney said: “The lands offer a purchaser an excellent opportunity to acquire a parcel of residentially zoned lands in a proven highly desirable residential location where demand outstrips supply.”
