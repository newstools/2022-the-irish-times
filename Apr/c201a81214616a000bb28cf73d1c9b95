Sligo Rovers 0 Bohemians 1 Bohemians picked up their first win in six games with a deserved defeat of an out-of-sorts Sligo Rovers side at the Showgrounds. Winger Liam Burt got the only goal of the game from a deflected 26th-minute strike, as the Bit O’Red side lost at home for the second successive game. Burt latched on to a pass from the impressive Promise Omochere and broke into the area before his on-target effort flicked off a defender and over the head of the helpless Ed McGinty. Without injured striker Aidan Keena, the hosts were blunted for long parts of the game, but did test Bohs goalkeeper James Talbot in the early exchanges through a Max Mata header. Bohs lost Rory Feely to an early injury, but Tyreke Wilson’s free-kick gave them a first opportunity at goal on the night, though McGinty was equal to it. The netminder was relieved to see Omochere’s effort on goal rise just too high soon after, but the striker was becoming more influential, and he led the counterattack that resulted in the goal five minutes later. The home side had a penalty appeal waved away by referee David Dunne before the break, but the visitors were good value for their half-time lead. The visiting side continued to shade the second half, though the game was devoid of clearcut chances until the closing stages. The best of those saw Sligo’s Mata off-target from a header, before substitute Paddy Kirk was also unable to convert when picked out by Karl O’Sullivan’s delivery.
