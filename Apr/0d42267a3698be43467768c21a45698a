Business travel specialist Taketwo hopes to lure custom from multi-national and local firms with the launch of an Irish office. The British company has taken over Cork-based CorporateTravel.ie, renaming it Taketwo Ireland. Paul Sexton, CorporateTravel.ie’s former co-owner and an industry veteran, will be Taketwo’s general manager here. The company provides specialised travel services to businesses and high-net-worth individuals. Taketwo said that Mr Sexton and his colleagues intended offering extra services to existing and new clients. The business also hopes to hire more staff. Mr Sexton pointed out that the Republic’s offered Taketwo with good opportunities. “There are also around 800 US companies operating out of Ireland or headquartered here, meaning there is huge potential for Taketwo to grow our business in this market,” he said. Chris Thelen, chief executive, Taketwo, said opening an Irish office would all the company serve current and prospective customers. “Taketwo is already established within the tri-state area of North America, including staff and operations in New York and Boston, which has a strong Irish connection,” he noted.
