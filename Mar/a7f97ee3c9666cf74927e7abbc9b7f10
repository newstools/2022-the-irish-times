A bill shared on social media this week showed a customer being charged ¤15 for tea/coffee and scones at Cashel Palace Hotel in Tipperary. The post demonstrated the high prices consumers are increasingly being asked to pay, as inflation climbs and price hikes kick in across the economy, driven by rising fuel costs, supply chain delays and – sometimes – businesses just asking a lot for a little. If you feel you’ve been charged too much for a product or service, please tell us about it using the form in this article, and we’ll consider it for an upcoming story. If you can upload a receipt or bill, that makes it easier to follow up. Thank you.
