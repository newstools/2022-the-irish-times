Sir, – In response to Brendan Kelly, who suggests that turning from fear to solutions is vital (Letters, June 3rd), I would like to propose a radical idea. It is that perhaps we don’t fear climate change enough. Social media, data, privacy, cookies, these things are intertwined with our real lives. Every swipe, click, like, comment, share and subscribe is monitored (just go to your Google ad settings and you’ll see). Therefore it’s easier to worry about such things as it affects us personally. In contrast, climate change is presented as nothing more than a trend. Put a jacket on your boiler, buy an electric car. Use your washing machine on low temperatures, take a walk today instead of driving. Recycle that coffee cup. Yea! That’ll solve climate change. We can’t change our ways of thinking if we don’t think about it at all. Nonetheless your letter writer gave me something to think about. – Yours, etc, DEBJYOTI HALDAR, Student, Trinity College Dublin.
