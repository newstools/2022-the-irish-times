Planning permission for hundreds of new homes at Dublin’s former Irish Glass Bottle factory site has been granted, its developers announced last night. A consortium of Ronan Group Real Estate, Oaktree Capital Management and Lioncor Developments said Dublin City Council had cleared the way for the first phase of the development, provided for under the Poolbeg West strategic development zone planning scheme. It will see the construction of 570 new homes and a total of 63,160sq m of mixed residential and commercial development, they said. “Located at the former Irish Glass Bottle factory, this approval represents the first step towards realising the development of the entire site,” a statement said. It said construction at the Ringsend site would begin this year. According to the statement, along with the privately owned and build-to-rent elements, one-quarter of all units will be allocated to social and affordable homes, providing what it describes as “one of the largest developments of social and affordable housing in recent decades”.
