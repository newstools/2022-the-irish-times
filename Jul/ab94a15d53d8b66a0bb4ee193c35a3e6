A Johnny Ronan firm has been refused planning permission to construct 141 homes in the Co Wicklow village of Delgany. In two separate decisions, Wicklow County Council has issued comprehensive refusals to J & Stylebawn Ltd’s mix of apartments and houses on the grounds of Stylebawn House. One application was for 20 one-bed apartments and 20 two-bed apartments in a five-storey block along with works to Stylebawn House, a protected structure, to provide a four-bed house and works to the a gardener’s cottage to provide a two-bed house. The second application was for 99 homes, consisting of eight one-bed apartments, 18 two-bed apartments, 14 three-bed houses and 59 four-beds. Delgany Community Council, along with local residents, lodged objections to the scheme. The council refused planning permission  on five grounds and found that the scheme would significantly alter the natural landscape and topography of the site. The council also found that the proposed development breached its development plan density rules and  was an overdevelopment of the site. In response to one refusal, Mr Ronan’s firm  lodged an appeal  with An Bord Pleanála over the 42-unit scheme and still has a number of days to lodge an appeal against the  refusal of the second proposal. In the appeal, consultants for Mr Ronan, John Spain & Associates, said that the scheme provided much-needed housing at a sustainable density in proximity to an existing village centre. Mr Spain argued that the site had “the capacity to provide for an increased residential density without significantly altering the character of the area”. Mr Spain also said that the scheme was of sympathetic design and  was in keeping with the character of the area.
