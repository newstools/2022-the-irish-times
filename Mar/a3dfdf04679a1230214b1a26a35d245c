The expected influx of hundreds of highly-paid professionals and hundreds more third-level students to two new residential schemes in the south Dublin village of Stillorgan should see strong interest in the sale of the well-known Boland’s pub. The long-established licensed premises is being offered to the market by agent Bagnall Doyle MacMahon at a guide price of €1.5 million. While the Boland’s existing drink-only turnover makes it an attractive proposition for pub operators, the selling agent John Ryan believes there are opportunities for the purchaser to further exploit the property’s potential in line with the continuing development of the surrounding area. Boland’s is situated on ‘The Hill’ overlooking the intersection of Lower Kilmacud Road and the Old Dublin Road in the heart of Stillorgan, a densely populated and extremely busy south Dublin suburb. The subject property is located directly across the road from the 232 concierge-serviced apartments that US real estate firm Kennedy Wilson is developing on the former Leisureplex site, as well as the 578 student bed spaces and 103 apartments Cairn Homes has planned for the plot once occupied by Blake’s restaurant. Taken together, the two schemes are expected to deliver in excess of 1,000 new residents to the doorstep of Boland’s pub. Boland’s currently comprises lounge bar facilities at ground-floor level with overflow capacity on the first floor and extends to 396sq m (4,262sq ft).
