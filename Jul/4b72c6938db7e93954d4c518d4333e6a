Sir, – Jason Fitzharris (Letters, July 8th) will be pleased to learn that the Irish Rail proposal for an airport heavy-rail link also aspires to an extension to Swords. It would also force the provision of additional capacity on the present railway from Clongriffin to the city. The revival of the original and sensible Luas plans to extend the existing Luas Green Line to Dublin Airport would serve DCU, Santry, and Ballymun. It would do all of this at a fraction of the cost of Metrolink – thus eliminating the need of airport users to change at least twice to access the national rail network, and a wait (at least) of 12 years! – Yours, etc, JIM DEEGAN, (former board member, National Transport Authority), Dublin 1. Sir, – I was going to write you a letter about the latest changes to the metro plan and how it’s such an embarrassment, but found that I had sent virtually the same missive on September 30th, 2021, when the Government announced a delay to the project. Maybe I’ll just send a revised version each year until it opens. – Yours, etc, CLAIRE BRADLEY, Swords, Co Dublin.
