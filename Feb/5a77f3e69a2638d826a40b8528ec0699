Cian Healy, Jamison Gibson-Park and Vakh Abdaladze have all signed new contracts with Leinster. As is their practice, Leinster did not reveal the length of the new deals when announcing the extensions via social media this afternoon. The 34-year-old Healy, a four-time European champion, is in his 16th season with his native province having made the first of 241 appearances thus far when making his debut against the Border Reivers in May 2007. He has also played 114 times for Ireland and been part of the 2018 Grand Slam as well as the Six Nations titles in 2014 and 2015, and takes him a step closer to realising his ambition of playing in a fourth World Cup. Gibson-Park, who turns 30 on Wednesday), is in his sixth season with Leinster since moving from New Zealand and in addition to making 108 appearances for the province, the scrumhalf has played 14 times for Ireland since making his debut in the rearranged Six Nations game against Italy behind closed doors at the Aviva Stadium in October 2020. Abdaladze made his Leinster debut in 2017 and made his Champions Cup debut in last month’s 64-7 win over Bath. The Georgian-born prop, who is 26, represented Ireland at under-20 level.
