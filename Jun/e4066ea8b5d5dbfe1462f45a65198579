Connacht have announced the signing of Bristol secondrow Joe Joyce. However, in a somewhat unusual move, the change of club has been announced a year in advance as the Bristol-born forward will not move to the province until the end of the 2022/23 season. Joyce, who has family from Galway, is Irish qualified and represented Ireland in the 2014 U20 Six Nations. A regular fixture in the side since their Championship days, Joyce has made over 150 appearances for the Bristol Bears and was part of their Challenge Cup winning squad in 2020. Joyce’s current coach at Bristol is former Connacht boss Pat Lam. “You don’t know how good you are until you put yourself into a different environment,” said Joyce in a video released by the Bears on social media. “It would be easier to stay here where I’m comfortable, have a testimonial and all that, which most people would do, but I just feel like it’s time for another challenge.” “We are thrilled Joe has chosen to join the club for the start of the 2023/24 season,” said Connaht head coach Andy Friend. “Whilst we know his arrival is still 12 months away, we are already excited by the prospect of what he will bring to Connacht Rugby and his signing represents a key addition to the squad we are looking to build. “Joe is a big physical lock, with excellent athletic and footballing ability and so he is a great fit for how we want play. Off the pitch Joe is also the type of player who understands the importance of community and I have no doubt he will make a positive impact in that area, something we as a club place a significant value on.”
