Mac Studio From €2,349 The supercharged Mac Studio was definitely an attention-grabber at last week’s Apple event. It comes in two versions: one powered by the M1 Max, and a second that features the new M1 Ultra chip. The latter is more expensive, as you might have guessed, given that it provides a serious leap in power. It’s 3.8 times more powerful than the most powerful 27-inch iMac, with the M1 Max version providing 2.8 times the power of the iMac. That makes the machine powerful enough to easily render massive 3D environments or tackle multiple video streams. The Mac Studio is also impressively compact, and has four thunderbolt ports for displays and other high-performance devices, a 10Gb Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port, and a pro audio jack. apple.com
