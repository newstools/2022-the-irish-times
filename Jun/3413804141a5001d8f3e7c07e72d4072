Sir, – The company I chair was sideswiped by Una Mullally in her condemnation of NewsTalk for not savaging Leo Varadkar when he pitched up to help celebrate its 20th anniversary (“Fine Gael is completely disconnected and does not even realise it”, Opinion & Analysis, June 27th). The side-swipe included describing Anton Savage as managing director of the Communications Clinic. He isn’t. Eoghan Tomás McDermott has been in that role for several years. It also tied me in as Anton’s mother. I am. But that’s not his fault. Me being his mother surfaced in a mention of an Irish Examiner column I wrote in 2018. It was about the danger to democracy of mainstream politicians talking conceptual English while populists talk the language of the people – “Get Brexit Done” being a classic example. Una Mullally’s selection from it tends to leave the impression that it promoted Leo Varadkar. It didn’t. – Yours, etc, TERRY PRONE, Chair, The Communications Clinic, Dublin 2.
