Republic of Ireland midfielder has been confirmed as moving to West Brom on a permanent deal after spending the last season on loan there from Brighton. Molumby, who has 12 caps for his country, had an option in his loan move for the permanent deal to be triggered once he played for West Brom 25 times. He has clocked up 30 championship appearacnes for Steve Bruce’s side this season. He has signed a three year deal that will keep him at the club until 2025. “He’s a young player full of energy and passion and we see plenty of potential in him to grow and develop further,” says Bruce. “He’s only 22 and he’s already played more than 75 games in the Championship. “He’s managed to force himself into our XI recently and now his challenge is to stay there by continuing to show improvements in his game.” The 22 year-old Waterford native came through Brighton’s academy but has stuggled for game time, making just five Premier League appearances before embarking on a series of loan spells. Brighton manager Graham Potter said: “Jayson has had a good loan experience at West Brom this season and played games regularly, which is good for his development. “This is a good move for him and on behalf of everyone at the club I wish him all the best for the next stage of his career.”
