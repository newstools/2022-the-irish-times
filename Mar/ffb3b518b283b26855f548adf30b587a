Janssen Sciences Ireland is expanding its biopharmaceutical supply chain facility in Ringaskiddy, Co Cork. The facility, which is part of the Johnson & Johnson group, will see a €150 million investment. Some 180 full-time jobs in facilities, engineering, quality, manufacturing and regulatory affairs could be created as a result of the expansion. Construction started in early 2022 and will take approximately two years to complete. Up to 300 people will be employed during the construction period. The site opened in 2005 and has a workforce of more than 700 people manufacturing medicines for immunology and oncology patients. The Cork plant makes drugs which treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and multiple myeloma, which is a form of blood cancer affecting the white blood cells made in the bone marrow. The expansion is supported by the Government through IDA Ireland. This announcement follows a €300 million investment in 2017, which saw the construction of a large-scale manufacturing suite at the site. This suite will shortly commence commercial operations after attaining all necessary manufacturing approvals. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the investment was “fantastic news” for Cork and for patients across the world who use the medicines made in Ringaskiddy. “I’m really proud of Ireland’s thriving life sciences sector. Investment like this demonstrates the strength of talent we have here. I wish the team the very best of luck and thank them for their continued commitment to Ireland.” Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, said Ringaskiddy is part of the very successful life sciences cluster which has been thriving in the south-west region for many years. “The further investment announced today, which will have a hugely positive economic impact on the area, both in the construction phase and upon completion of the project, is very welcome.”
