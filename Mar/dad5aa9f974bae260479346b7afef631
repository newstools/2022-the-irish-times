Dresses remain firmly in fashion focus, perennial wardrobe favourites that have always done double duty for work or play are having a post-Covid moment. The new season’s affairs are bright and colourful with feminine detailing – embroidery, lace, even feathers to tickle the fancy. For those who rock a frock in both winter and summer, sometimes there is no real seasonal difference – other than how to style it in a modern way. The heavy jumper over a maxi dress was a common winter street trend; for any time of year a black bomber jacket achieves the same aim, generating instant cool and warmth, while another way of grounding a short flouncy frock is teaming it with trousers, or layering a midi with a tunic or a cute cashmere cardigan. Irish designers make their own statement when it comes to dresses. Katie Ann McGuigan’s printed silky silhouettes have become more alluring and adventurous as her confidence develops, and later this year for her winter 22 collection she has put her hand to leather with the same assurance and bravado. Fiona Heaney, taking her cue from dance for her spring FeeG collection, captures a carefree Covid-free spirit with colour, embellishment and embroidery with beguiling overlays of tulle. Louise Kennedy keeps to her signature shapes, but uses lace in her delicate, elegant way with feather trims that add luxury to a simple navy or pink shift. In terms of spring trends, micro mania – tiny skirts and tiny tops – as seen so dramatically on the catwalks of Milan and Paris may not excite universal desire. Letting go of the comfort of winter’s tracksuit bottoms and hoodies will tempt many into less sporty, dreamier attire, dresses that can be floral, printed, graphic in midi or maxi lengths from wraps to button through, from shifts in solid colours to flirty embroideries and other whimsical feminine details. There has never been a season with so much vibrancy and sensual appeal that only a forgiving summer frock, free of constraint, can bring.
