By Shane Stokes Daire Feeley ended the longest Irish drought in Rás Tailteann history on Sunday, becoming the first home winner since Stephen Gallagher in 2008. The Cork All Human/Velo Revolution rider seized the yellow jersey on Friday’s third stage, defended it on Saturday and carried it into Sunday’s final stage with a 51 second advantage over the British rider Louis Sutton (Spain Brocar-Ale). Sutton told the Irish Times before the stage that he would keep fighting on the final 135.3 kilometre stage to Blackrock in County Louth, but instead it was Feeley who went on the attack, first bridging across to a two man break with Marc Potts (Tyrone Team Caldwell Cycles) and then, following their recapture, going again inside the final 30 kilometres. He joined up with William Perrett (Dublin Spellman Dublin Port), Archie Ryan (Ireland National Team), Dean Watson (Britain Embark-Bikestrong) and Aaron Watson (Down Powerhouse Sport) and while the latter subsequently slipped back, the other four had a lead of 27 seconds with 15 kilometres remaining. They were eventually reeled in, but Feeley’s attack rather than defence policy was both typical of his racing style and also something which was all but unheard of by a yellow jersey on the final stage of any recent edition of the Rás. The 25-year-old finished safely in the main bunch and ended the five-day race 51 seconds clear of Sutton and one minute and six seconds ahead of Adam Ward (Ireland National Team). “People think I am crazy attacking the whole time but I think I’ve actually ridden the Rás very similar to the way that I normally ride any race in Ireland,” he told the Irish Times. “The beauty of it was to take the pressure off the team on the finishing circuits. That made the job a lot easier, and they were able to just monitor moves and have me in my position out of trouble as I crossed the line. So it worked out really well in the end.” Embraced by his teammates and congratulated by riders and officials, he was emotional at the stage finish. He described his feelings coming up the finishing straight. “It was amazing. Amazing. It didn’t hit me until I stopped. I just remember coming around the corner with 200 metres to go and Richie [team-mate Richard Maes] said to me ‘you’ve won the Rás, boy.’ That was brilliant, so it was. “That is the first time I have ever cried when I won a bike race. It means so much to me. It’s an incredible feeling.” The stage victory went to another young Irish rider, the 20-year-old Kevin McCambridge (Britain Trinity Racing). He surged clear on the tough finishing circuit, making his move after Feeley’s group was reeled in and shortly before starting the final 9.9 kilometre lap. He had a 20-second lead with five kilometres to go and reached the line three seconds clear of stage one winner Matthew Teggart (Cycling Ulster) and the rest of the main bunch. “The Rás is like the world championships for an Irish rider. It is just amazing. The crowds, the people…I was so happy,” he said of his win. In the end it was a superb Rás for Irish riders. In Feeley, Ward, Rory Townsend (Ireland National Team), Teggart and Luke Smith (Meath Moynalty Cycling Club), they took five out of the top six places. They won four out of five stages, and Townsend and Dean Harvey (Ireland National Team) took the points classification and King of the Mountains respectively. The race is back on the road after a four-year absence and while a title sponsor is needed to ensure it goes ahead next year, the huge crowds at the finish in Blackrock, the festive atmosphere and the passion shown by riders and officials alike are all huge pluses.
