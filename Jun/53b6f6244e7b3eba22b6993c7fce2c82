Sir, – Your headline “1.3 million on some form of waiting list for healthcare services” (News, June 6th) says more about our national obsession with “tests” than it does about unmet need. Levels of genuine illness associated with that level of health service demand do not exist in the western world. – Yours, etc, Prof DECLAN LYONS, University Hospital Limerick. Sir, – Are we the unhealthiest nation in the world? We surely must be given that more than one million of our total population of five million are on hospital waiting lists as widely reported through multiple media outlets. I suggest that the first place to start reducing this astronomical figure is for us all to make better lifestyle choices. – Yours, etc, KATHRYN MacQUILLAN, Killiney, Co Dublin.
