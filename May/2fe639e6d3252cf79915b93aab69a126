Wayne Barnes has been chosen to referee the Heineken Champions Cup final between Leinster and La Rochelle at the Stade Vélodrome on Saturday week (May 28th). It will be the Englishman’s third final, having refereed the deciders in 2010 and in 2018, when Leinster beat Racing 92 in Bilbao. The vastly-experienced Barnes will be taking charge of his 90th tournament match and his assistants will be the English duo, Matthew Carley and Christophe Ridley, with Tom Foley (England) as TMO and Stefano Marrama (Italy) as Citing Commissioner. Another Englishman, Luke Pearce, who was in charge for last season’s Champions Cup final, will be the referee for the EPCR Challenge Cup final between Lyon and RC Toulon at the Stade Vélodrome the night beforehand, Friday May 27th. Two Irish officials, Andrew Brace and Frank Murphy, will be his assistants, with Ian Tempest (England) as TMO and Ed Kenny (Ireland) as Citing Commissioner.
