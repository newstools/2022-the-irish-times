Two very tasty Spanish wines from Supervalu this week, both on sale for €10 a bottle. Spain continues to offer great value for money with a range of fascinating wines made from their own indigenous grape varieties. I featured this wine at the start of this year, but it offers such great value for money at €10 a bottle, that I include it again. It has plump rounded pear and peach fruits with a lively citrus acidity. Perfect on its own, or with most seafood, and a great partner for prawns. The Monastrell grape is originally from this part of Spain, but is very successfully grown in France, where it is known as Mourvèdre. Here in Yecla, it produces swarthy full-bodied red wines. This organic wine from Castaño, one of the leading producers in the region, is rich and rounded with ripe dark fruits with smoky, spicy notes. Perfect with barbecued red meats.
