Dan McFarland has signed a contract extension to stay on at Ulster until 2025, the province has announced. Having joined the Belfast outfit in 2018, this extension will see him become the longest tenured coach in the province’s history. Ulster are still awaiting a first piece of silverware since 2006 having been knocked out of the United Rugby Championship this season by the Stormers at the semi-final stage. It was the second last-minute defeat in a knockout game this year for the province after a late Antoine Dupont try knocked them out of Europe at the last-16 stage. Despite that, McFarland has earned plaudits for the progress made at Ulster, particularly in bringing through an exciting group of young backs headlined by Robert Baloucoune, Mike Lowry and James Hume. “I am delighted to have extended my contract with Ulster Rugby, and I would like to thank Jonny Petrie for all his support over the last four years,” said McFarland on signing a new deal. “I love my job here, which is only possible because of the good people I get to work with. It is through the growth, competitiveness, and teamwork of the support team and the players that we continue to compete for championships. “However, the fact remains our ultimate goal is to win championships. I am looking forward to driving the process of finding, guiding, and supporting the people capable of doing that for this province and its passionate supporters, who truly share in our joy and pain. “The challenge ahead is immense but that is why it is so exciting. For me, it has the feel of unfinished business.”
