Belfast-based Rocket Flair Studios has won a multi-million pound contract with a leading worldwide games developer. The Irish game development firm is to create a small number of jobs on the back of the deal. The new roles include full stack and front end developers, quality assurance, and lighting and animation engineers. “Since establishing in 2017, we have used the latest immersive technology like augmented reality and virtual reality to create specialist city builder games for PC gamers, such as our mythical ancient Egypt city-builder Dynasty of the Sands,” said managing director James Bradley. “We are delighted that our innovative products have led us to secure a multi-million pound contract with a prominent global games developer. This is a huge step forward for us, especially as 94 per cent of the sales from the project will be in markets outside Northern Ireland. This will bolster our reputation globally,” he added. Overall the company is investing over £700,000 (€841,000) in the business to scale to meet the demands of the contract. Invest NI has offered Rocket Flair Studios £98,000 of support towards the creation of the 14 jobs. “Rocket Flair really understands the global gaming industry and has created a niche with Dynasty of the Sands, which it has received worldwide recognition for. Securing a multi-million pound contract at such an early stage in its business is a significant achievement” said Susan O’Kane, Invest NI eastern regional manager.
