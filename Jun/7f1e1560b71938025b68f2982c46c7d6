A chara, – I agree entirely with SB Breathnach view (“Gaeilge agus TFI”, Letters, June 8th). TFI, Transport for Ireland is neither original nor distinctive. It is merely a bland imitation of TfL,Transport for London and its several spin-offs – Transport for Wales, Transport for Greater Manchester, Transport for Cornwall, etc. It seems that certain brand designers are so lacking in creative inspiration and appreciation of national cultural identity that the best they could produce is an imitation of someone else’s efforts, backed by a garish and mediocre colour scheme not unlike those now proliferating on buses in Britain at the present time. Sasana nua darb ainm Éire? Could I suggest “Iompar Éireann – Transport Ireland” as a suitable bilingual alternative? It could be supported by a revival of the iconic winged wheel symbol, designed by Frank Brandt, which served as an unique identifier of our national transport system from 1945 until 1963. – Is mise, CYRIL McINTYRE, Celbridge, Co Kildare. A chara, – Is trua liom a cloisint go bhfuil brón ar SB Breathnach, faoi easpa téarma Ghaelach ar TFI. Measaim go bhfuil “Taisteal Faoi Impróir” oiriúnach. – Mise, PATRICK JUDGE, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin. A chara, – Maidir leis an litir ó SB Breathnach ag gearán nach raibh leagan Gaeilge ar fáil do TFI ar na busanna, ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú dó go mbíodh leagan Gaeilge in úsáid i bhfad roimh TFI - CIÉ, Córas Iompair Éireann. – Is mise le meas, SEÁN Ó BRIAIN, Deepforde, Droichead Átha.
