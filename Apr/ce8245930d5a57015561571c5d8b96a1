Christy Ring Cup front runners Derry and Kildare both cruised to comfortable wins in their first round games against Wicklow and Mayo respectively on Sunday afternoon, joining London on top of the table following the Exiles’ 0-26 to 0-21 win over Sligo on Saturday afternoon. Kildare were devastating in the second half of their 5-26 to 0-11 win against Mayo as they turned a five-point half-time lead into a 30-point win. Paul Divilly’s goal was the first score of the second half and from there David Herity’s side continued to build on their lead with some well taken scores. Kildare firmly seized control as four further goals from Mark Delaney, Cathal Dowling, Brian Byrne and Jack Sheridan laid down a marker for the competition favours. League Division 2B winners Derry dug deep to earn a 1-21 to 1-9 win over Wicklow. The Oakleafers took control in the opening half but they saw their lead cut to seven points when Eoin McCormack goaled for Wicklow. However, Fintan Bradley replied less than two minutes later with a goal for Derry which moved the game beyond the gutsy Wicklow side. Derry started well, moving 0-7 to 0-2 in front with Odhran McKeever, Ciaran Hendry and Cormac O’Doherty impressive in the opening stages. Brandon Ryan helped Wicklow cut their gap to three before a brace of placed balls from Cormac O’Doherty helped Derry to lead by 0-11 to 0-6 at half-time. Derry continued to find scores easier to come by and even when McCormack netted for Wicklow, they were never under any real pressure.
