Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract with Liverpool to 2025. The forward’s deal was due to expire in a year and the agreement makes him the highest-paid player in the club’s history. Negotiations had been protracted and appeared to have stalled but Liverpool found a way to structure the deal within their model. Under its terms Salah will be rewarded according to the number of goals he scores or is involved in. Talks accelerated in recent days and culminated in a club delegation flying to see Salah and closing the deal. The Egyptian will be just past his 33rd birthday when the contract ends. “I feel great and (I am) excited to win trophies with the club,” Salah told Liverpool’s website. “It’s a happy day for everyone. It takes a little bit of time, I think, to renew, but now everything is done so we just need to focus on what’s next. “I think you can see in the last five or six years the team was always going (upwards). Last season we were close to winning four, but unfortunately in the last week of the season we lost two trophies.

We just need to keep working hard, have a good vision, be positive and go for everything again.” Salah had said he would stay at the club next season, raising the possibility he would then leave on a free. He has been at Liverpool since 2017 and this summer has seen an overhaul of Jürgen Klopp’s attacking options, with Sadio Mané, Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi leaving and Darwin Núñez and Fabio Carvalho joining. — Guardian
