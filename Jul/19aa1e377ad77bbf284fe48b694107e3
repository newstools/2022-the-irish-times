Sir, – Rafael Nadal had to miss his semi-final place owing to injury sustained in his quarter-final match and his semi-final opponent got a bye into the final. Surely there should be provision for the beaten quarter-finalist in such a scenario to be offered the opportunity to take up the semi-final place? This would ensure a competitive semi-final and even up the odds for the other prospective finalist, who will otherwise be at the disadvantage of possibly playing a tough five-set semi while his opponent, benefitting from a bye, has the opportunity for much more rest and recovery. – Yours, etc, PATRICK O’SULLIVAN, Rochestown, Cork.
