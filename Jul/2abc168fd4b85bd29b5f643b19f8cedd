Sir, – Nuala Delaney is quite right to suggest (Letters, July 6th) that we should not be concerned about our dependence on corporation tax receipts so long as they are invested wisely in education and infrastructure. I don’t think the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would take issue with such a use of our windfall yield from corporation tax. The problem, of course, is that the Government has been doing nothing of the sort. Rather it has been blowing the receipts from the years of plenty on recurring expenditures instead of making once-off investments which would produce some benefit for our children and grandchildren. We did exactly the same with temporary excess tax receipts from property in the lead-up to the last crash. But, as ever, we have learned nothing. – Yours, etc, PAT O’BRIEN, Dublin 6.
