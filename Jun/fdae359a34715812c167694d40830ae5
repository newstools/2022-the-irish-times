Two Spanish wines from SuperValu this week. Torres is one of the best-known and respected names in wine. Based in Catalonia—or Catalunya, as they’d call it themselves—the firm produces a range of wines from the least expensive to some of the most sought-after in Spain. Vintae is a much younger, smaller, dynamic wine company that is growing rapidly. It, too, produces wines from various parts of Spain, including this (almost) sulphur-free version. As sulphur dioxide is a byproduct of fermentation, all wines will contain a minute amount. Made without any added sulphur dioxide, this has light, soft, easy green fruits with toasted almonds and a dry finish. Drink solo, with lighter fish dishes or with summer salads. For many years Sangre de Toro was a red wine from Catalunya that came with a plastic bull attached to the neck of the bottle. These days the brand has expanded to include other parts of Spain, including Rioja. This is a nicely made wine with attractive pure dark-cherry fruits with a hint of spice on the finish. Try it with grilled lamb chops or dishes featuring roast red peppers. Very good value.
