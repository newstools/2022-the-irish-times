The West Ham defender and French international Kurt Zouma has pleaded guilty to animal welfare offences over video footage showing him kicking and slapping a cat. Zouma appeared at Thames magistrates court alongside his brother Yoan who filmed the video that appeared on social media in February to widespread condemnation. Kurt Zouma pleaded guilty to two offences under the Animal Welfare Act. In the footage, Kurt Zouma was seen dropping, kicking and slapping one of his cats, while laughter can be heard in the background. The 27-year-old then chases the pet before throwing a pair of shoes at it and slapping its head. The prosecution was brought by the animal welfare charity the RSPCA. The brothers were bundled into the court by their security guards, as they held coats over their faces. Zouma apologised after the footage appeared. Yoan, 24, admitted one offence during the hearing. – Guardian
