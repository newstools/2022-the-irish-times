59-year-old amateur jockey Simon Condon has won his first race after 40 years of trying. Riding aboard Eat the Book at Kilbeggan on Thursday evening, Condon, who is a health assistant in his day job, crossed for his first victory on the 40-1 runner. It was a landmark first win also for the horse Eat the Book, a nine-year-old trained by David Dunne. His journey too is one of peaking later in life after a recovery from injury in his younger days that led to fears he would have to be put down. Mark Walsh aboard A Different World was alongside Condon and Eat the Book at the last jump, only for the duo to hit the front and ease home by five and a half lengths. Speaking to RacingTV after his win, Condon, who first raced back in 1982, spoke of his delight at finally getting that first scalp. “I’ve been waiting a long time for this,” he said. “It’s hard to describe the feeling. Normally when I ride, there are always horses in front of me. To be in front, with nothing ahead of you? Oh my God, I got some buzz out of that. It’s the best feeling ever. “It was amazing to pass the line in front, a day I’ll never forget. I’ll probably get emotional about it tomorrow. “Eat The Book was a handful in the early days and I’ve had a fair few falls off him; he’s broke me up a good few times. Now, he’s a grand horse but he’s owed me that. “My Dad bought him for me to ride and David’s (Dunne, the trainer) done a great job training him. He broke his elbow in Thurles and the prognosis was very bad. It’s been some training performance to get him back.”
