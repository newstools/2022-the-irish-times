Sir, – I refer to Mary Carolyn’s article noting that there are 45 barristers per 100,000 population compared with 25 in comparator jurisdictions (“Ireland has too many barristers, with many suffering financially, EY report finds”, News, July 1st). Compare this with another legal statistic in the 2018 report published by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) that found there was an average of 21 judges per 100,000 people among the countries covered, with significant differences between states. The report noted Ireland has just 3.3 judges per 100,000 people. It is no wonder that some judges are retiring early in Ireland. – Yours, etc, JONATHAN ROTH, Limerick.
