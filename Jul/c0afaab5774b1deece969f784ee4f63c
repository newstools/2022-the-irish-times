Derby County have announced the signings of Ireland’s Conor Hourihane and David McGoldrick. Central midfielder Hourihane has penned a two-year contract with the Rams, running until the summer of 2024, after successfully completing a medical. He had spent the previous season on loan at Sheffield United. The 31-year-old left Villa at the end of his deal in June, with 151 appearances and 29 goals to his name in the West Midlands. McGoldrick has linked up with Derby on a one-year contract, which will run until the summer of 2023, after recently leaving Championship outfit Sheffield United. The 34-year-old was a key figure for the Blades, winning Player of the Season in their promotion season and in their second season in the Premier League. “It’s a massive club. Everyone knows that with the manager and players that they have had in recent history, especially the years that I’ve been playing against them in the Championship,” McGoldrick said. “What stuck out for me last year was when I was at Sheffield United and we lost 2-0; the place was rocking. To say where Derby were in the table and the stuff that was going off, I couldn’t believe it. “I‘ve never been blistering quick, that has never been part of my game, but I don’t think you ever lose it in your brain and that’s the main thing. I still feel as hungry and ambitious as ever and I know I can still play at the top level, but this is a big pull for me.”
