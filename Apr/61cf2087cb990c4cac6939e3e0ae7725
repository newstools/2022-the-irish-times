Tournament organisers have confirmed that 15-time Major champion Tiger Woods is to participate in the 2022 JP McManus Pro-Am at Adare Manor, July 4th –5th. Woods will join a world-class field of players including Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Leona Maguire, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Mark Wahlberg, Niall Horan and many more. It will be Woods’ fourth appearance at the fund-raising event which supports charitable organisations throughout the mid-west of Ireland. Tournament host, JP McManus, expressed his delight at the news: “Tiger has been a great friend and avid supporter of the Pro-Am for a very long time and we are absolutely thrilled he has committed to play once again in the tournament. “ His presence at Adare Manor will undoubtedly bring huge excitement to the thousands of spectators and we are very grateful to him for giving up his free time to be with us.” Organisers have also announced a ticket tender for the sold-out event, with 100 tickets on offer at a minimum of €250 per ticket. The internationally recognised Pro-Am has helped raise over €140 million for charitable organisations in the mid-west region of Ireland since its inception in 1990 and attracts many of the world’s top players and celebrities to participate at the Tom Fazio redesigned golf course. All funds raised are distributed in their entirety to the beneficiaries.
