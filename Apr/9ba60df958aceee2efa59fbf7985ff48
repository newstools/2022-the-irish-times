Former Ulster loose-forward Pedrie Wannenburg has been killed in a car crash in Texas, his former South African franchise the Bulls said on Saturday. Wannenburg, 41, played 20 times for the Springboks between 2002 and 2007, and was close to being selected for the World Cup-winning squad in France. He also turned out for Irish side Ulster and French club Castres before settling in the United States in 2016. He died when a 16-year-old driver led police on a high-speed chase and crashed into the back of Wannenburg’s car at an intersection, according to local media. His wife and two children were in the vehicle with him but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. Ulster Rugby said they were “deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing of former flanker, Pedrie Wannenburg following a car crash in Texas. “The Springbok played a major role in Ulster’s Heineken Cup and Pro12 campaigns, making 54 appearances for the Ulster men between 2010 and 2012.” The flanker was the first to play 100 matches for the Bulls in Super Rugby and won three titles with the Pretoria-based side in 2007, 2009 and 2010. – Reuters
