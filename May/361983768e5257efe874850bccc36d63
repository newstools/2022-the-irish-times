Kylian Mbappé has rejected the chance to join Real Madrid and chosen to renew his contract with Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish champions had been confident of landing the forward after recent positive talks but Mbappé called the club president, Florentino Pérez, on Saturday afternoon to communicate his decision. Mbappé’s mother, Fayza, had said on Friday that her son had received almost identical offers from the two clubs. The player’s decision is a significant blow to Madrid, who had expected to land one of the world’s most sought-after strikers on a free transfer, and a huge boost to PSG, where he has agreed a new three-year deal. Mbappé joined PSG from Monaco in 2017 in a deal worth up to €180m and had wanted to move to Madrid last summer, only for several offers, the last worth €200m on deadline day, to be rejected. PSG’s sporting director, Leonardo, admitted Mbappé had been keen to leave but said Madrid’s initial bids did not meet their valuation and that they were not willing to do business in the final week of the window.
