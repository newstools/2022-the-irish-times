Discount retailer Aldi has signed a new €100 million deal with Kilkenny-based Iverk Produce to supply 150 stores with Irish-grown and packed potatoes. Iverk, which is one of the largest suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables in Ireland, has worked with Aldi since 1999, supplying the chain’s Irish stores with carrots and potatoes. The five-year extension of the contract will see it supply 24,000 tonnes of locally grown potatoes to Aldi annually, accounting for 75 per cent of Aldi’s range of Irish Rooster, Maris Piper, Maritiema, Kerr Pinks, Golden Wonders and baby potatoes. “Iverk has supplied our Irish stores for more than 20 years and we are delighted to further extend our partnership for another five,” said Aldi Ireland group buying director John Curtin. “Aldi is committed to supporting Irish growers so our customers can enjoy the very best vegetables.” The contract will allow Iverk to invest in a new state-of-the-art packhouse that will bring its existing lines into a fully automated packhouse, supporting future growth and development. Boost “This is a massive boost for both our staff and growers in this difficult climate we find ourselves in,” said James O’Shea, Iverk Produce. “Working with Aldi has given us the security to expand and invest in our business and we look forward to working with Aldi for many years to come.” Aldi works with more than 330 Irish food and drink producers, spending €1 billion with Irish suppliers in 2021. The retailer has invested more than €3 million since 2018 in its supplier development programme, Grow with Aldi, which helps artisan Irish food and drink producers get their products listed in Aldi’s stores. The retailer employs more than 4,650 people and it plans to invest €320 million by 2024 to grow its share of the Irish grocery market, including the opening of 30 new stores across the country.
