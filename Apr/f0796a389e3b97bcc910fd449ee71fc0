German energy giant RWE is to spend up to €1.5 billion in Ireland on large-scale renewable energy projects between now and 2030. The company said it was undertaking long-term investments in onshore wind, offshore wind and battery storage projects across Ireland with an objective to grow a renewables business across a portfolio of technologies. The Irish spend is part of wider €50 billion investment to expand its green generation capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2030 RWE’s largest development project in Ireland is currently the Dublin Array offshore wind project, which it is developing in partnership with Saorgus Energy. The project will have between 45 and 61 wind turbines located on the Kish and Bray banks about 10 km from the coast of south Dublin and north Wicklow. Once fully operational, it will be capable of generating between 600 megawatts (MW) to 900MW of clean electricity. It also has an onshore windfarm at Dromadda Beg, near Listowel in Co Kerry, and 8.5MW battery storage facility at Balbriggan, in Co Dublin, which was the company’s first such project in Europe. The company has also developed a 60MW battery at Lisdrumdoagh in Co Monaghan, which can store enough electricity to power about 125,000 homes. Speaking ahead of today’s Wind Energy Ireland conference in Dublin, at which RWE is the main sponsor, Cathal Hennessy, RWE Ireland country chair, said: “Renewable energy can help Ireland meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets and will also play a key role in delivering energy security for the Irish economy. “But this will only happen if the correct policy frameworks are in place and adequate resources are available within key areas such as planning and energy provision,” he said.
