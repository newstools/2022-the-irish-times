1st – Tea Olive – 445 yards, par 4 A deep bunker on the right of the fairway and trees both sides make for a daunting start, while long and left of the undulating green both spell big trouble. Unsurprisingly played the hardest hole on the course in 2012 and again in 2017. 2021 average: 4.216 (rank 6th) 2nd – Pink Dogwood – 575 yards, par 5 Driving into the trees on the left cost Pádraig Harrington a nine in 2009, but Louis Oosthuizen memorably holed his second shot for an albatross in the final round in 2012. An important early birdie chance and the easiest hole in 2016, 2020 and 2021. 2021 average: 4.551 (rank 18th) 3rd – Flowering Peach – 350 yards, par 4 Shortest par 4 on the course but a pear-shaped green with steep slope in front allows for some wicked pin positions. Charl Schwartzel pitched in for eagle in the final round en route to the title in 2011. 2021 average: 3.898 (rank 14th) 4th – Flowering Crab Apple – 240 yards, par 3 The back tee – not always used – turns it into a beast, with the green sloping from back to front. Phil Mickelson took six here in the final round in 2012 and finished two shots outside the playoff. Jeff Sluman’s ace in 1992 remains the only hole-in-one here in Masters history. 2021 average: 3.304 (rank 3rd) 5th – Magnolia – 495 yards, par 4 Jack Nicklaus twice holed his second shot in 1995 and Colin Montgomerie did it in 2000, but it is another devilishly difficult green. To clear the fairway bunkers requires a 315-yard carry and the hole was lengthened by 40 yards for 2019. 2021 average: 4.431 (rank 1st) 6th – Juniper – 180 yards, par 3 From a high tee to a green with a huge slope in it. Five holes-in-one – including Jamie Donaldson in 2013 – but Jose Maria Olazabal took seven in 1991 and lost by one to Ian Woosnam. 2021 average: 3.166 (rank 8th) 7th – Pampas – 450 yards, par 4 What used to be a real birdie chance has been lengthened by 35-40 yards, while trees were also added and the putting surface reshaped. More bunkers – five – around the green than any other hole. 2021 average: 4.297 (rank 4th) 8th – Yellow Jasmine – 570 yards, par 5 The bunker on the right, about 300 yards out, pushes players left and from there it is harder to find the green in two up the steep hill. Still a good birdie chance and Bruce Devlin made an albatross two in 1967. 2021 average: 4.625 (rank 16th) 9th – Carolina Cherry – 460 yards, par 4 The tee was pushed back 30 yards in 2002. The raised green, with two bunkers on the left, tilts sharply from the back and anything rolling off the front can continue down for 50-60 yards. 2021 average: 4.113 (rank T10th) 10th – Camellia – 495 yards, par 4 A huge drop from tee to green on this dogleg left and over all the years of the Masters the most difficult hole. It was here that Rory McIlroy began to fall apart in 2011 with a seven, while Bubba Watson clinched the title in 2012 by making par in the playoff from the trees. 2021 average: 4.219 (rank 5th) 11th – White Dogwood – 520 yards, par 4 The start of Amen Corner. Toughest hole in 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2018 and extended by 15 yards in 2022. Best remembered for Larry Mize’s chip-in in 1987 and Nick Faldo’s back-to-back playoff wins. 2021 average: 4.399 (rank 2nd) 12th – Golden Bell – 155 yards, par 3 Probably the most famous par 3 in golf. Narrow target, water in front, trouble at the back, it has seen everything from a one to Tom Weiskopf’s 13 in 1980. Defending champion Jordan Spieth took seven in the final round in 2016 in a dramatic back-nine collapse and Tiger Woods made 10 in the final round in 2020. 2021 average: 3.113 (rank T10th) 13th – Azalea – 510 yards, par 5 The end of Amen Corner. Massive dogleg left with scores ranging from Jeff Maggert’s albatross two in 1994 to Tommy Nakajima’s 13 in 1978. Sergio Garcia saved par after a penalty drop from a bush in 2017, went on to beat Justin Rose in a playoff and named his first child Azalea 11 months later. 2021 average: 4.622 (rank 17th) 14th – Chinese Fir – 440 yards, par 4 The only hole on the course without a bunker, but three-putts are common on the wickedly difficult green. Course record holder Nick Price took eight here in 1993, while Phil Mickelson holed his approach en route to his 2010 victory. 2021 average: 4.014 (rank 12th) 15th – Firethorn – 550 yards, par 5 Often a tough decision whether to go for the green in two across the pond on the hole where Gene Sarazen sank his 235-yard 4-wood shot for an albatross in 1935. There have also been three 11s here and the hole was lengthened by 20 yards in 2022. 2021 average: 4.767 (rank 15th) 16th – Redbud – 170 yards, par 3 Tiger Woods’s memorable chip-in in 2005 came the same year as 73-year-old Billy Casper’s 14, while Pádraig Harrington, Shane Lowry, Ian Poulter and Tommy Fleetwood are among the players to record holes-in-one. 2021 average: 2.996 (rank 13th) 17th – Nandina – 440 yards, par 4 The famous Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering storm damage, making for an easier tee shot on the hole Justin Rose double-bogeyed when one off the lead in 2007. Jack Nicklaus birdied here to take the lead as he won his 18th Major in 1986. 2021 average: 4.191 (rank 7th) 18th – Holly – 465 yards, par 4 The drive through an avenue of trees was made much harder when the tee was moved back 60 yards in 2002. The fairway bunker from which Sandy Lyle got up and down to win in 1988 is now 300 yards away. 2021 average: 4.141 (rank 9th)
