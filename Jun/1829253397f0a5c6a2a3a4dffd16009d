Phonovation has been named as the overall winner of this year’s Deloitte Financial Services Innovation Awards. The Dublin-based communications tools company, which provides secure messaging and mobile identity services to business in Ireland and Britain, took the main prize in the third year of awards designed to recognise industry innovation. The awards are run in partnership with the Banking & Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and Financial Services Ireland (FSI). “Businesses should take pride in the resilience and innovation they have shown over the last few years, and as they look forward to new challenges, innovation will be central to adapting product lines and maximising customer experience and engagement,” said Deloitte Ireland head of financial services Donal Lehane. “The companies both shortlisted and awarded this year showcase the breadth of innovation happening across the financial services sector in Ireland.” Phonovation was also named the winner in the category of most disruptive fintech after its Mobile ID service impressed judges.
