Juventus expect Paul Pogba to sign a contract with them at the beginning of next month after a verbal agreement was reached for the midfielder’s return. Pogba’s departure from Manchester United at the end of his deal has been confirmed and Juventus have agreed to pay a net salary of €8m a season before bonuses. Final details for the move are being discussed. The France international rejected an approach from Manchester City and is poised to rejoin the club where he spent four seasons from 2012. It means Juventus would twice have signed him for nothing after his exits from United and sold him back to the Premier League club for £93.2m in between. Pogba won Serie A in each of his four seasons at Juventus. The club finished fourth last season, 16 points off the champions, Milan, and have turned the forward Federico Chiesa’s loan from Fiorentina into a permanent transfer. Inter are continuing to push to sign Romelu Lukaku. The striker has been clear with Chelsea that he wants to leave and Inter are the only club he is interested in. Talks over a loan fee are continuing and Lukaku, who had a successful spell with Inter from 2019-21, is ready to take a salary cut to make the move. - Guardian
