Sir, – Alan Shatter attempts to justify Israel’s “international legitimacy” by sourcing his justification on “the 1947 UN General Assembly resolution prescribing Israel” as an independent state (”Ireland lags the rest of Europe in fighting anti-Semitism”, Opinion, June 13th). This is rich in light of the 45 UN Assembly resolutions passed since 2006 condemning Israel’s behaviour in the region, all of which Israel fails to recognise. If Mr Shatter’s benchmark for international legitimacy is the UN, then it would only be fair to have a discussion on these other 45 UN resolutions, including the most recent UN output defining Israel as an apartheid state. – Yours, etc, TOM HARPER, Blackrock, Co Dublin.
