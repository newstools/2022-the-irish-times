Sir, – Coffee costs 20 cent per cup to produce which includes costs. That’s a maximum cost. Yet our fellow countrymen and women who run coffee shops are charging nearly €3 a cup . Anyone who sets up a coffee shop could sell coffee for €1 and make money. If they don’t do it I will, and open one beside them and make a very large profit. Don’t believe me? Check it out at the wholesalers in the Netherlands. – Yours, etc, NIALL HOGAN, Monkstown, Co Dublin.
