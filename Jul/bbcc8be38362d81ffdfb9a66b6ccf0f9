A teenage boy has drowned in the Irish Sea off north Co Dublin. Gardaí and emergency services attended the scene at Burrow Beach near Sutton at 7.30pm on Monday after the teenager got into difficulty while swimming. The lifeguard on duty contacted the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre. The Rescue 116 helicopter, Howth RNLI and an Irish Coast Guard unit were also involved in the search. A spokesman for the Irish Coast Guard said an “extensive search” of the area off the beach was needed before the teenager was located.  He was taken to Beaumont Hospital and then to Temple Street Children’s Hospital in Dublin, where he later died. A second teenager was also rescued from the water at the same time. In a statement, Fingal County Council extended its sympathy to the family and friends of the teenage boy who died “despite the efforts of lifeguards, Coast Guard and other emergency services”. “We are assisting An Garda Síochána with their investigation,” it added. The incident occurred on the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures in the Dublin area reaching 27 degrees. Independent councillor Jimmy Guerin said locals were shocked following the “tragic accident”. “It’s normally quite a safe environment. I don’t think we should attribute blame here. People around my age who have children are very shocked about what happened,” he said. Fine Gael councillor Aoibhinn Tormey offered her condolences to the family and said it was a “horrific incident”.
