Dan Whelan’s New Orlean’s Saints will be playing in London on October 2nd after the NFL has announced its international schedule for the 2022 season. Aaron Rodgers’ Green Bay Packers will also travel to the UK take on the New York Giants. After signing on Saturday as an undrafted free agent, Whelan faces a battle to be named the punter on the Saints roster but should he be successful, the Enniskerry man faces the prospect of playing close to the country of his birth during his rookie season. The Packers become the 32nd and final team to play in the capital since it first hosted a regular-season game in 2007 and will take on the Giants at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on October 9th. The Jacksonville Jaguars continue their commitment to London when welcoming the Denver Broncos, and their new quarterback Russell Wilson, to Wembley Stadium on October 30th. Having beaten the Miami Dolphins at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last season, the Jags return to their home away from home as they play under the arch for the eighth time since 2013. Shahid Khan, Jags owner and chairman of Sky Bet Championship winners Fulham, said: “We were the first NFL team committed to play multiple games at Wembley and will be playing a home game here each season for at least the next three. “We have the largest social following of any NFL team in the UK, our foundation continues to expand, and we intend to keep growing. “I look forward to being back in London to watch Fulham and the Jaguars play, in what I think will be a hugely exciting year ahead for fans of both teams.” Elsewhere, Tom Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers will take on the Seattle Seahawks as Germany hosts its first NFL regular-season game on November 13th at Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena. The final international game takes place on November 21st in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca, where the Arizona Cardinals take on the San Francisco 49ers in an all-NFC West encounter.
