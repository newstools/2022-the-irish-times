Former Eir chief executive Carolan Lennon has been named country leader of Salesforce Ireland, replacing David Dempsey. Ms Lennon, who left Eir last month, will start in the new role in July. She was the first woman to lead the telco after she replaced Richard Moat as head of the company in 2018. Salesforce, which currently employs almost 1,400 people in the Republic, provides customer relationship management (CRM) solutions to clients including Accenture, Intel, Adidas, Merck and Sky. Founded by Marc Benioff and Parker Harris in February 1999, the company is headquartered in San Francisco. It opened its first international hub in Dublin just a year after it commenced operations. Core functions at the Irish operation include sales, customer service, operations and engineering. She joins the software giant shortly before the opening of Salesforce Tower Dublin on North Wall Quay. “I am excited to join the next chapter of success at Salesforce in Ireland,” said Ms Lennon. “Salesforce is a unique company, focused on providing leading technology whilst being committed to a set of core values and the wider role that businesses can play in society. I can’t wait to join this talented team and continue its outstanding work.” Ms Lennon joined Eir in 2010, serving in a number of senior roles before being chosen to lead the company. She also previously worked at Vodafone Ireland. Dr Dempsey, who led Saleforce Ireland for the past 22 years, will remain as a senior advisor and board member of the company. The company announced plans to create 1,500 jobs in Dublin over a five-year period in 2019 to coincide with the move to Salesforce Tower Dublin.
