Republic of Ireland v Wales, La Manga stadium, Spain, 2.30pm - live on FAITV (YouTube) The starting XI named by Vera Pauw for Tuesday’s Pinatar Cup third-place play-off will be more informative than usual as it reveals whether the teenagers - Ellen Molloy, Jess Ziu or Abbie Larkin - have done enough to alter the selection status quo. “Tuesday we go for the win,” said Pauw after Saturday’s 1-nil defeat to Russia, “and we go for the best team with the best balance. It will be a team that we would line up for a qualifier.” The next World Cup qualifier, against Sweden in Gothenburg on April 12th, effectively doubles up as the Group A decider, so it will be fascinating to see if Pauw rewards Molloy’s nimble footwork and Megan Walsh’s shot-stopping with another opportunity. Walsh, having declared for Ireland last year after coming through the English underage ranks, looks like a real find. The 27 year old made five outstanding saves against Russia, while distributing and controlling her area with authority. She appears to have done enough to dislodge Everton’s Courtney Brosnan but either way this “friendly tournament” has served its purpose. Ireland (possible): Walsh (Brighton); Fahey (Liverpool), Quinn (Birmingham City), Caldwell (Manchester United); Ziu (Shelbourne), Connolly (Brighton), O’Sullivan (NC Courage), McCabe (capt, Arsenal); Molloy (Wexford Youth), Payne (Florida State) Kiernan (Liverpool).
