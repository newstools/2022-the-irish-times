Sir, – I have to take issue with Dr Reggie Spelman when he asserts (Letters, June 7th) that those with private health insurance have “never languished in a public hospital emergency department.” Those who are forced to take out hugely expensive private health insurance, because the public service is dysfunctional, get no priority in a public emergency department. They share the same languish. – Yours, etc, JOHN GRIFFIN Kells, Co Meath.
