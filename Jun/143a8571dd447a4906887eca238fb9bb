Sir, – The letters in relation to the issue of the Angelus on RTÉ seem to have the intent of trivialising the debate. The Angelus endeavours to remind all of us of the importance of loving our neighbour, as distinct from following the motivation of arrogance and contempt for our neighbour. – Yours, etc, ANTHONY LEAVY, Sutton, Dublin 13. Sir, – The arrival of spring is signalled each year in your letters page by the appearance of accounts of the first sightings of the cuckoo in various parts of the country. Not long afterwards the publication of the first letters sneering at the broadcasting of the Angelus on the national airwaves is a sure sign that the silly season has arrived! – Yours, etc, PADDY BARRY, Killiney, Co Dublin. Sir, – One of the few tunes I can play on the piano. – Yours, etc, DAVID CURRAN, Knocknacarra, Galway.
