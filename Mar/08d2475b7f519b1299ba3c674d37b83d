The Olympic Federation of Ireland (OFI) has marked International Women’s Day by announcing a newly established Gender Equality Commission. This will be a sub-committee of its board. Visibility and the gender imbalance in coaching will be the two key areas targeted by the commission. It will be made up of a number of figures from Irish sport and beyond. Lochlann Walsh, former president of Triathlon Ireland and OFI board member, will chair the group. Former RTÉ deputy head of sport Clíona O’Leary, world champion boxer Bernard Dunne, soccer coach Lisa Fallon, founder of the Sport for Business Community Rob Hartnett and former army Lieutenant Deirdre Carbery are the commission’s other members. Carbery has a background in gender, diversity and inclusion with the UN and NATO to progress the Women, Peace and Security Agenda internationally. The move comes after the OFI approved in 2020 a motion for a minimum gender balance of 40 per cent for its board. Commenting on the new Gender Equality Commission, OFI president Sarah Keane said “This level of expertise on this Commission is very strong and gives us a real platform to drive further changes needed within Irish sport. “The members are passionate about gender equality and in each of their spheres - from media to coaching and administration - both inside and outside of sports have already done very significant work, breaking barriers and providing the challenges needed for real change.”
