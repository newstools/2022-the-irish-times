Sir, – Emma DeSouza contrasts the “shared island” concept with the reality of life in Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, counties cut off from rail links, with woefully inadequate cross-Border transport (“Lack of public transport leaves Ireland a disconnected island”, Opinion & Analysis, June 21st). Following the 2006 St Andrews Agreement, the Irish government agreed to co-fund the construction of the A5 Western Transport Corridor – a Derry to Dublin motorway. The commitment survived the November 2010 cutbacks. In October 2017, Leo Varadkar emphasised his “cast iron” commitment to the road to help ameliorate the adverse impact of Brexit on Derry and Donegal. He added: “I want to see that project go ahead as quickly as possible. I also believe that the completion of routes from Dublin to Derry and Donegal should be a strategic priority for governments both north and south.” Last week, I again “enjoyed” the meandering, though highly scenic, five-hour trip from Dublin. – Yours, etc, Dr JOHN DOHERTY, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall. A chara, – Emma DeSouza crystallises the problems which beset rural transport in both parts of Ireland. Apparently, the Irish Government has “earmarked” ¤35 billion for projects to be completed by 2030. That works out at ¤5 billion per annum. Do we have any details as to where this colossal sum is going? Does the sum include, perchance, yet more roads? The Irish rail network needs some joining up and joined-up thinking; the Rosslare to Cork and Drogheda toKingscourt lines could be reestablished and extended. A Limerick to Sligo line? A proper rural bus service could also be established, using larger towns as hubs. The blueprint could be taken from any number of European countries which are properly connected for the 21st century. Rural public transport is not just a lifeline; because it often is a lifeline, it becomes a right. – Is mise, TERRY WALSH, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain.
