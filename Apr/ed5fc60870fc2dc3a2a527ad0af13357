Delays in implementing a planning exclusion for solar energy installations shows a “lack of strategic commitment” from the Government to the State’s climate action objectives and targets, the Micro-Renewable Energy Federation (MREF) has said. Its chairman, Pat Smith, said “repeated delays” in implementing a “meaningful exclusion” from planning requirements for solar energy installations was undermining renewable energy projects that businesses and farming were committed to undertaking. “The need for these exclusions was raised by MREF four years ago and committed to by every government since, including government ministers, yet we still don’t have the planning exclusions that the micro-renewable energy sector needs,” he said. “Frankly, there can be no justification for the length of time it has taken to implement these necessary exemptions.” Mr Smith welcomed the latest commitment to deliver on these planning exclusions from Green Party TD Steven Matthews. However, he said it was “disgraceful” that the issue had taken four years to reach this point. “Despite repeated commitments from many government ministers and TDs, including this measure being referenced in government programmes and climate action plans, we still have no sight of what these exclusions will be,” he said. Mr Smith said planning approval was not required for rooftop solar system sizes of up to 1MW, or over 5,000sq m, in the UK, and a similar size exclusion should apply in Ireland. Furthermore, he added, ground-mounted solar PV installations of less than a hectare should also be planning exempt.
