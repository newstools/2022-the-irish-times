Sir, – Could the Conservative 1922 Committee please obtain character references from the leadership candidates’ former nannies, to help them avoid electing another monstrous toddler? – Yours, etc, HAZEL COFFEY, Westport, Co Mayo. Sir, – Having been an early supporter of “herd immunity” in relation to Covid-19, Boris Johnson is now painfully aware that there is no such thing as “immunity from the herd”. – Yours, etc, DAVID LOUGHLIN, Rathmines, Dublin 6. Sir, – The headline over Denis Staunton’s article on the Irish Times website on Saturday states that “British politics has become a game of snakes and ladders on speed” (July 9th). I always thought that it was just a game of snakes and more snakes. – Yours, etc, DENIS MURPHY, Clonskeagh, Dublin 14.
