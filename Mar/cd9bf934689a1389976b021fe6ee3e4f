Vladimir Putin’s former local pub in Dresden has barred the Russian president for life and is donating 10 per cent of daily tips to help Ukraine. For four years until 1989, Putin lived in the Saxon capital as a KGB agent and liked to end his work days with a cool beer in the pub Am Thor. “But if he should ever show up here again, he can turn on his heel and go . . . I’ve banned him for life,” said landlord Joachim Müller. Long-serving staff remember the Russian regular as “quiet, withdrawn and matter of fact”, someone who liked to drink the regional Radeberger beer but could be tempted occasionally to try some schnapps and the local spiced minced beef special. “But now he’s done a complete 180 degree turn . . . he’s a war criminal,” said Müller, adding that serving staff have committed to donate 10 per cent of their daily tips to Ukrainian refugees for food and other supplies. Final break In a taste of things to come, the pub dismantled a devotional altar to the politician three years ago in protest at his politics towards his neighbours. On Friday afternoon, staff said the final break with its famed customer occurred with little fuss or sentimentality. Waitress Josi Kickelheim said it was too quiet in the pub to know how regulars would react, but that all staff support the ban. “We are giving money and food to Ukrainian refugees and try to support them as we can,” she said. “We can’t do much but we’re doing our best.” It’s unclear if the Russian leader has any plans to return to Am Thor. His last official visit to Dresden was in 2009 to collect a “medal of thanks” from the Saxon capital for his “battle for good”.
