Armagh’s Tiernan Kelly has received a 24-week ban for the eye-gouging incident that marred Sunday’s All-Ireland quarter-final against Galway. Both teams will pay €10,000 fines for their part in the melee which kicked off as the teams left the pitch after normal time. Galway won the match after a penalty shoot-out. Kelly, who missed the contest through injury was not togged out. Armagh GAA say they will accept the proposed bans, following the conclusion of an investigation by the GAA’s Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) this week. [ As it Happened: All-Ireland quarter-finals - Galway (after penalty shootout) and Kerry reach final four ] Armagh’s Conor Turbitt and Blaine Hughes, as well as Galway’s Cathal Sweeney have all received proposed one-match penalties. All three were substitutes. Galway captain Sean Kelly and Armagh’s Aidan Nugent — both were shown red cards ahead of extra-time in Croke Park for ‘contributing to a melee’ — as well as Greg McCabe who was sent off during normal time, have also received proposed one match suspensions. The latter’s suspension is expected to be doubled however, as it is a repeat infraction. Sean Kelly’s appeal hearing will take place on Friday evening. Galway take on Derry in eight days, on Saturday July 9th, in the All-Ireland semi-final. [ Darragh Ó Sé: The worst thing about Sunday’s melee is politicians making hay out of it ] A statement from Armagh GAA on Friday read: “Following the investigation carried out by the CCCC, Armagh GAA can confirm the players and county board have accepted the proposed penalties. There will be no further comment.”
