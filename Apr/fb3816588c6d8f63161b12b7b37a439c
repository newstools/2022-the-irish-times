Gardaí have begun a murder investigation after a man was shot dead in Finglas, north Dublin, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The victim’s body was still at the scene on Deanstown Avenue on Sunday morning pending the arrival of a pathologist to carry out a preliminary examination of the remains in situ. While the 29-year-old dead man has not yet been named, he has been identified by gardaí and has been involved in organised crime in the Finglas area, where he also lived. Gardaí believe he was aligned to a gang in the area that was involved in a feud with another crime gang from Finglas. The rival gang is led by a man in his 20s who has emerged in recent years as a key figure in organised crime in the north Dublin suburb and surrounding areas. While gardaí have carried out significant operations in recent months against the gang leader and his associates, feuding has been worsening in the Finglas area. One early line of inquiry is that the shooting dead of the man early on Sunday is feud-related. However, Garda sources stressed the investigation was still in its infancy. “Gardaí and emergency services attended the scene at approximately 4.30am. A man, aged in his 20s, was discovered with a gunshot wound and was pronounced dead at the scene,” Garda Headquarters said of the man’s killing. The scene was sealed off and secured immediately when gardaí arrived. A pathologist was due to carry out an examination of the remains in situ on Sunday morning before the man’s remains could be removed for a postmortem. An examination of the scene was also being carried out by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí in Finglas are investigating and have appealed for anyone with information about the killing to come forward.
