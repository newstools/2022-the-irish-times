“My husband and I have been going to the West Cork Chamber Music Festival in Bantry for about 12-13 years,” begins a mail from a reader who has asked to remain anonymous. She stresses that she is not looking for help but would like to highlight price increases of late and how they have impacted her annual holiday. Each year from the end of June to the beginning of July the couple usually “have rented a two-bedroom cottage from Rent an Irish Cottage and have always found it very satisfactory, especially as we can rent for 10 days and not the usual Saturday to Saturday”. She says the price has crept up slightly over the years and in 2019, the last time they were there, they paid €650. “This year we are paying €1,140. Are we mad? Inquired around but nothing suitable or cheap to be found.” She has a breakdown of the prices. The 10 nights cost €1,200 with utilities charged at €8 per night or €80 in total. There is a service charge of €40 but they get a discount of 15 per cent on the €1,200 because they are repeat customers. That is worth €180. “In previous years utilities were paid according to meter reading on leaving. That suits us as the cooker is never turned on and there is no heat as we are out at concerts. There is lots of lovely cold food in Bantry SuperValu.” She also says in times past there was no service charge. A reader called Nick uses Tesco Quad Strength Lime Squash “to help me drink a couple of pints of water a day”. It is a sugar-free product and he says his increased water intake, with the help of the squash, his long daily walks and a healthier diet has helped him to lose more than three stone in weight. So far so good, right? “The lime juice was always 99c or less per bottle before the pandemic. Now it is €2.05.” If you have noticed a price increase please let us know. pricewatch@irishtimes.com
