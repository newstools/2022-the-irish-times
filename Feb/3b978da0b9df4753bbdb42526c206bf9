The US named Zach Johnson as their 2023 Ryder Cup captain on Monday, with the two-time Major winner succeeding Steve Stricker in the role. The US defeated Europe 19-9 to win the Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits last year, but the team have not won the competition on European soil since 1993. The 2023 Ryder Cup will be played from September 25th to October 1st, 2023, at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Rome. “To accept this captaincy, to lead this United States Ryder Cup Team abroad – after what we accomplished last year at Whistling Straits – is simply the greatest honour of my professional career,” Johnson said in a statement. “As exciting as this is for both my family and me, it is equally sobering to understand the scope of our challenge in Rome, as we have not won on the road in three decades. “To win, we will have to outplay a European Team that will have both ample talent and motivation on their side. I am anxious to dig in and begin the process of putting our team in the best possible position to succeed.” Johnson is the 30th US captain since the Ryder Cup’s inception in 1927. He has played in five Ryder Cups and served as the vice-captain in the last two editions of the competition. In his first appointment as Ryder Cup captain, Johnson named Stricker the first of his vice-captains. The six remaining slots on the US team will be captain’s picks and will be announced by Johnson following the 2023 Tour Championship.
