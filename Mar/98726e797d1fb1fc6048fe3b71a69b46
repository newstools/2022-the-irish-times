Tom Duffy of Duffy’s Circus has died aged 92, one of the great figures of Ireland’s circus families Steeped from birth in the tradition of the travelling circus, Tom was born in his mother’s caravan in Limavady, Co Derry, in 1929, while the family circus was performing there. One of seven brothers and one sister, he started performing in the circus ring at the age of five. As he grew, he performed a double trapeze act with his brother, Arthur, and was known as the boy with the iron jaw, as he would hold his brother from a leather strap held between his teeth while suspended upside down from the trapeze 40 feet above the audience. He was also an expert horse rider and, following the deaths of his parents, he ran the family circus with his six brothers. In 1979 he decided to put his own show on the road with his wife, Gertie, and their son, David, and on his 50th birthday, Tom Duffy’s Circus gave its first performance in Blessington, Co Wicklow. In later years he battled ill health but could be seen during each performance sitting in his director’s chair at the front of the big top, keeping an eye on all activities. Tom’s son, David, said: “My Dad was a legend. He dedicated his whole life to entertaining the Irish public. His legacy will live on. His name will always be up in lights inside the big top. To his family, he will always be the greatest showman”. Tom is survived by his son, David, daughter-in-law, Stephanie, grandsons, Tom and Jamie, and his brother, Freddy. Duffy’s Circus is currently touring its big top around Ireland. In a statement it said: “As is the wish of Tom, all performances of his circus this week will continue as scheduled. As Tom often said, ‘the show must go on’.”
