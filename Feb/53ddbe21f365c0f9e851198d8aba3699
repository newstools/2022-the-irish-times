Aer Lingus lost €347 million last year as tough Government Covid-19 curbs continued to hit air travel, new figures show. International Airlines’ Group (IAG), the Irish carrier’s parent, said on Friday it cut losses in 2021 to €2.9 billion from almost €7 billion the previous year. The group’s accounts show that Aer Lingus’ operations lost €347 million in 2021, around 5 per cent less than the €361 million the Irish carrier company shed in 2020. IAG acknowledged that travel restrictions in the Republic and UK hit Aer Lingus and its sister airline British Airways harder than the group’s Spanish carriers, Iberia and Vueling. Aer Lingus ended the year with €228 milion in cash, €38 million less than the €266 million it held on December 31st 2020. Total capacity IAG’s figures show that Aer Lingus was flying at just 15 per cent of its total capacity in the first quarter of last year, when Government restrictions were tightest. This rose to 44.3 per cent in the final three months of 2021. “The emergence of the Omicron variant impacted demand, mainly in December, as governments introduced stricter travel requirements and border restrictions in response,” said IAG. Luis Gallego, IAG chief executive, confirmed that a strong recovery was under way. “All our airlines continued to show improvements in the fourth quarter, optimising their performance and further improving their operating results,” he said.
