A man has been charged with company law offences arising from an investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the State’s corporate watchdog said. Robert Browne (52), with an address at Treanlawn, Killoe, Co Longford, appeared before Dublin District Court on Thursday. He faces 14 charges of providing false information contrary to Section 876 of the Companies Act 2014. The charges follow an investigation by the ODCE in relation to the unauthorised and unlawful use of an auditor registration number in the submission of annual returns to the Companies Registration Office. Det Garda Keith Gorman, an officer of the ODCE, informed the court that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that the accused be sent forward to the Dublin Circuit Court for trial on indictment. Mr Browne was remanded on continuing bail to June 3rd.
