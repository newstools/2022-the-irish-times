Plans for a 14-storey developments on Dublin’s Prussia Street have been turned down by An Bord Pleanála. The fast-track proposal had envisaged 162 apartments in a build-to-rent scheme. It was part of a double-whammy for developer Randelswood as the planning board also turned down permission for its strategic housing development 130-apartment scheme at Dolcain House, Monastery Road, Clondalkin. Planners said the proposed scheme, next to the Technological University (TU) Grangegorman campus, would compromise the coherent redevelopment and regeneration of the site and have an overbearing impact on the historic streetscape of Prussia Street and the adjoining conservation area at St Joseph’s Road. The appeals board also found that the design of the scheme would be a visually dominant feature in the wider city landscape. Planning consultants Downey Planning, for the developers, had contended the scheme would be beneficial for Prussia Street, the college campus and the surrounding environs, and represented an ideal location for residential development which enjoys the provision of a wide range of services. It said the apartments would be suitable for graduates and young professionals, and also argued that the development would form a distinctive new residential neighbourhood of a density and character that assimilates well to its location. On the Clondalkin plan, An Bord Pleanála said it was not satisfied that a neighbouring asphalt plant would not seriously injure the amenities of future occupants of the scheme. Dolcain House is currently an office scheme. The redevelopment proposed to create 61 one-bedroom, 59 two-bedroom and 10 three-bedroom apartments on the site.
