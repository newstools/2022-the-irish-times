This week the UK introduced a Bill to unilaterally scrap the Northern Ireland protocol, the post-Brexit set of rules which govern Northern Irish trade. The EU has now launched infringement proceedings against the UK for not complying with significant parts of the deal, which it describes as a clear breach of international law. So, what happens to the protocol now? Does this reopen the debate about a hard border between north and south? And, will there be a trade war between the EU and UK? In the latest episode of The Irish Times Inside Business podcast, Ciarán Hancock is joined by Public Affairs Editor Simon Carswell, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland Stephen Kelly and Robert Sweeney, a policy analyst at TASC, to discuss this standoff over the protocol.
