The US Senate has voted 65-33 to approve a bipartisan gun-safety Bill in what is the most significant legislation on the issue in three decades. Fifteen Republican senators broke with their party to vote in favour of the Bill. However, the vote came the same day the Supreme Court struck down a New York law that required people to show a special need to carry a handgun in public, ruling for the first time that the Second Amendment protects gun rights outside the home. Deep divisions remain in the country on gun policy against the backdrop of recent massacres at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, where 31 people were killed last month. Senators, who have long struggled to find common ground on gun safety, restarted stalled negotiations after those killings, producing a Bill aimed at improving background checks, securing schools and giving states federal funds to combat gun violence. The House is expected to pass the Bill and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature before leaving for a two-week recess. Under the legislation, every state will have the opportunity for grants to help pay for crisis intervention programmes, regardless of whether they set up “red flag laws that allow judges to remove guns from potentially dangerous owners. It also provides for improvements to the national background check system, including giving states incentives to upload records to allow better reviews of gun purchasers aged 18 to 21. The Bill includes billions of dollars in funding to help secure schools and bolster mental health resources. The National Rifle Association announced its opposition to the Bill earlier in the week. “This legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, and use federal dollars to fund gun-control measures being adopted by state and local politicians, the NRA said in a statement. — Agencies
