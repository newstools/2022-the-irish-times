James Ryan and Ryan Baird have been ruled out of Ireland’s final 2022 Guinness Six Nations match against Scotland at the Aviva Stadium next Saturday (kick-off 4.45pm). The IRFU have confirmed that Ryan “will not be considered for selection this week and his return to rugby protocols will be supervised by the Leinster medical team”. This follows Ryan’s latest concussive episode as a result of the high, head-to-head hit by his English counterpart Charlie Ewels that earned the latter a second minute red card in Ireland’s 32-15 win at Twickenham last Saturday. Baird, who deputized for Ryan when the latter had an adductor issue against Italy, has been ruled out of consideration for next Saturday’s finale and tilt at the Triple Crown and the championship title with a back issue. The uncapped Ross Molony and Leinster academy loock Joe McCarthy have been called up to train with the squad. Molony has been involved in Ireland squads since the summer of 2021 while McCarthy, a former Ireland Under-20 player who will only turn 21 later this month, made his Leinster debut against Cardiff in January having impressed for Dublin University in the Energia AIL and has made three appearances in total It seems likely that in the absence of Ryan and Baird, that Iain Henderson will partner Tadhg Beirne in the second-row with Kieran Treadwell on the bench. Robert Baloucoune, Nick Timoney and Mike Lowry all return after lining out for Ulster in the URC against Leinster at the weekend. The game is being televised by Virgin (ROI) and ITV (NI).
