Okta, a San Francisco-headquartered company that has developed a popular identity and access management platform, is to create 200 jobs in Dublin over the next two years. The move comes as the company is due to open a new office locally next month. Okta said it will initially be targeting employees for customer-facing roles but will over time also be looking for staff across research and development, accounting, recruitment and HR. The investment is supported by IDA Ireland. Founded in 2009, Okta’s solutions are used by more than 15,000 companies, including DCC, ITV, Renault, Siemens and Pret a Manger. “This new office gives us an exciting opportunity to serve our regional customers and leverage Ireland’s diverse and unique talent pool to accelerate our vision of enabling everyone to safely use any technology,” said Susan S Ledger, president of worldwide field operations for Okta. Okta, which recorded $1.3 billion in revenues last year, has bolstered its market share in identification after acquiring rival platform Auth0 for €6.5 billion in May 2021. The company is forecasting turnover of between $1.78 billion and $1.79 billion for its next financial year.
