Sir, – I may not be 100 per cent sure, but I’m reasonably sure that your report of Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis saying the “band is, like, 155 per cent Irish” is wrong (“Red Hot Chili Peppers in Dublin: ‘This band is, like, 155 per cent Irish’”, June 30th). What I remember Kiedis saying is that “Chad is 155 per cent Irish”, (referring to drummer Chad Smith), which got a huge roar from the crowd. Furthermore, in relation to your comments on the weather, the sky was only partially overcast and the sun shone throughout from the southwest. Public transport, or the lack of it, was the only real black cloud on the horizon that evening and Dublin once again proves to be Europe’s blackspot when it comes to moving around quickly and efficiently. There were similar public transport problems on the previous two nights last week with concerts in Marlay Park. This surely raises questions for the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority. – Yours, etc, LIAM O’GRADY, Galway.
