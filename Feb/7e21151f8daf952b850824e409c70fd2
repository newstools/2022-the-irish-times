Shane Lowry gave himself an outside chance of winning the Honda Classic in Florida after a third-round 67 left him five shots off the lead. American Daniel Berger is still favourite to lift the title on Sunday as he sits well clear at the top of the leaderboard on 11 under, despite his worst round of the tournament, carding a 69. Offaly’s Lowry made some ground, though, with a three-under-par 67, sinking four birdies and a bogey to register the best round of the day and give himself hope of a third PGA Tour title. Sepp Straka, Kurt Kitayama and Chris Kirk are also tied for second with Lowry on six under. Englishman Lee Westwood slipped down the leaderboard after a one-over-par 71 to sit on even, a shot ahead of compatriot Ian Poulter.
