Sir, – In response to Steven Maloney’s letter (June 27th), could it be that the problem is that the pre-2012 salaries for consultants were too high? It depends on what type of society we want; as Mick Lynch of the UK rail union said, if we want a fairer society us better-paid people are going to have to accept a little less. Consultants, even at the newer salaries, are still among the best-paid people in the country. – Yours, etc, MARY MURTAGH, Dublin 9.
