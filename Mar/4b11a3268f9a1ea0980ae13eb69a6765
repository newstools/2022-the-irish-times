Munster prop Jeremy Loughman has been called up to the Ireland squad after Andrew Porter was ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations with an ankle injury. It is expected that Cian Healy and Dave Kilcoyne will split the loosehead duties while Loughman will provide cover. It has emerged that Leinster wing Jordan Larmour picked up a hip injury during Leinster’s win over Benetton on Saturday and has been ruled out of contention for the rest of the championship. Iain Henderson returns to camp after coming through 80 minutes unscathed for Ulster after recovering from Covid. Provincial teammates Robert Baloucoune, James Hume and Nick Timoney also return to the squad. Jack Carty, Dave Heffernan, Craig Casey and Gavin Coombes are the other players who saw game time for their provinces who are called back in by Andy Farrell. Leinster’s Jimmy O’Brien will be staying with Leinster after spending the week prior to the Italy win in the Ireland camp.
