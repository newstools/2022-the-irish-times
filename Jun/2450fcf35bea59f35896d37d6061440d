Sir, – Chrissie Byrne’s excellent suggestion (Letters, June 23rd) of an RTÉ Prayer app to provide the Angelus could be expanded to include a soap opera with a religious theme. It could be called Prayer City. – Yours, etc, BRIAN AHERN, Dublin 15. Sir, – A “Godcast’'? – Yours, etc, PAUL DELANEY, Dalkey, Co Dublin. Sir, – People object to the Angelus, citing its lack of inclusivity. That is clearly not the case. The silence in between each toll is there for a reason. – Yours, etc, EUGENE TANNAM, Dublin 24.
