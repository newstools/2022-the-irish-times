Davy Stockbrokers has settled a claim made to the Workplace Relations Commission by a long-serving broker in its equities division. Madeleine Larchet lodged a complaint with the director-general of the commission against J&E Davy Ltd, trading as Davy Stockbrokers, which was called for a remote adjudication hearing this morning. It’s not known under what legislation Ms Larchet made her complaint, but five hours had been set aside to hear submissions and evidence on Tuesday. Opening the hearing, adjudicating officer Jim Dolan said he understood the matter had come to a settlement. “We’ve managed to reach an agreement between the parties,” said Cliona Kimber SC, appearing for Ms Larchet. Mairead McKenna BL, for Davy, confirmed that was the position. Mr Dolan thanked them for their attendance and congratulated them on coming to an agreement. “We had a degree of interest from the public in this one so I’m sure [the press] will be disappointed it’s settled,” he added. He said the matter would be adjourned for six weeks before being struck off.
