Theo Cullinane is to step down as chief executive of Bam contractors after 13 years, the company said on Thursday. Mr Cullinan, a chartered engineer, has worked with Bam for 43 years. In addition to being chief executive, he also serves as chairman of the company. Bam said the recruitment process to find Mr Cullinane’s replacement is at an “advanced stage.” “It has been an honour for me to spend my full professional career working for Royal Bam Group. I would like to thank the executive board for their steadfast support on the many developments and new initiatives on diversification and sustainability over the years,” said Mr Cullinane, who retires in June. Ruud Joosten, chief executive of Royal Bam Group, thanked Mr Cullinane for his “very significant contribution.” “During Theo’s tenure, which spanned the financial crisis of 2008 and the current pandemic, BAM has developed into a market leader in the development and construction of large-scale building projects in the Public, Private and PPP sectors while maintaining its position as leader in the civil engineering market in Ireland. “BAM is now well placed, as a construction company and employer of choice, for the future development of our business in Ireland’, he said.
