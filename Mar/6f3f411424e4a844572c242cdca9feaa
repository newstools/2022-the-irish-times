Dyson is bringing its expertise to a new market with the launch of the Dyson Zone, a wearable air purifier and noise cancelling headphones in one. It may sound like a device dreamed up in the midst of the pandemic, but Dyson has been hard at work on this one for about six years. It went through 500 prototypes before it eventually came up with the Zone you see before you. In a time when we are all a little more conscious of air quality, the Dyson Zone could be the answer to your pollution worries. The device is capable of filtering city fumes and pollutants, sending a steady stream of purified air directly to your mouth and nose. The important thing is that the visor doesn’t touch your face, so it is contact free, and allows you to breathe naturally. Does it look unusual? A little, but probably not as much as it would have pre-pandemic, before masks became a common sight. On the audio side of things, Dyson is promising immersive, high-fidelity sound and advanced active noise cancelling so you can tune out all the unwanted noise on your trip, whether it is a plane journey or your daily commute. It’s designed to be as comfortable as possible, so you can wear it for as long as you need to. There is no date or pricing for the Zone, but Dyson said it would be coming later this year.
