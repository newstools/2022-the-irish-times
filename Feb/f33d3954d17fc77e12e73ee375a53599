The RTÉ News Channel will broadcast the women’s FA Cup clash between Liverpool and Arsenal next Sunday. There is a big Irish interest in the fifth round tie, given the potential involvement of internationals Megan Campbell, Niamh Fahey and Leanne Kiernan in the Liverpool side, while Ireland captain Katie McCabe has established herself as a vital member of Arsenal’s starting XI. Kick-off is at 12pm on Sunday. Lisa Fallon will be among those on commentary duty.
