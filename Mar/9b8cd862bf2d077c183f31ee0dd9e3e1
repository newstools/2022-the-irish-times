Agent CBRE is guiding a price of €6.75 million for a site with full planning permission for the development of 92 apartments and associated commercial space on the seafront in Bray, Co Wicklow. The site, on the Strand Road between the Old Bray Head Hotel and the Star Casino and facing on to Bray Promenade, extends to 0.6 hectares (1.47 acres) and is occupied by a commercial car park and two residential units fronting on to Coastguard Terrace. The property is zoned SF-Bray Seafront – “To provide for the development and improvement of appropriate seafront uses” under the Wicklow County Council Development Plan 2016-2022. Existing planning permission has been in place since November 2017 for the development of 92 residential units comprising 11 three-bed apartments, 60 two-bed apartments and 21 one-bed apartments, along with 2,120sq m (22,819sq ft) of commercial space. A feasibility study for an alternative development option has been undertaken by Plus Architecture, which suggests the site could accommodate 101 residential units and ancillary retail space at ground floor – subject to planning permission. Further information on the feasibility study is available upon request. The property is 1.5km from Bray town centre. Dublin city centre is about a 40-minute drive away, while the surrounding villages of Greystones, Enniskerry and Shankill are 15-20 minutes from the subject site. The area is well connected by public transport, with numerous bus routes including the 145 and 155 providing links to Dublin city and the surrounding area along the N11. Bray Dart station is a 15-minute walk away, providing access to Dublin city centre in about 40 minutes. The site is 5km from junction 7 of the M11 motorway, giving ready access accessibility to the Greater Dublin Area and the southeast of Ireland.
