Sir, – I disagree with Roisin Wyley’s letter (July 2nd), referring to PhD graduates over the last 10 years, stating that “the vast majority of these graduates have little or no employment”. This seems unlikely, given that HEA’s graduate survey in 2020 concluded that 91 per cent of research graduates were in employment nine months after graduation, the majority in Ireland. While these numbers included research masters students, the majority of research degree graduates hold PhDs. The PhD graduate rates of pay and employment are also considerably higher than those for level six , seven and eight graduates. If in fact the vast majority of PhD graduates had little or no employment, it would seem a waste of resources to produce more. The statistics quoted apply to graduates employed in all sectors, not just third-level institutions. Funding and career prospects for PhD graduates within third-level institutions could certainly be improved, but the career prospects for a PhD graduate are good, overall. – Yours, etc, CONALL DORAN, Atlantic Technological University, Sligo.
