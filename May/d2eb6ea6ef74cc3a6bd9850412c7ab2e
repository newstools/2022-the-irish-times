Bohemians v Sligo Rovers Dalymount Park, 7.45 A lack of consistency has plagued both this season. Albeit primarily against the top four sides, it’s just one win between them from their last eight games combined – and that a Bohemians 3-0 win versus UCD. The Dubliners would welcome a repeat of their win, and performance, at Sligo early last month. Derry City v Dundalk Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium, 7.45 The game of the night as second host third. After defeat at leaders Shamrock Rovers last week, erstwhile pacesetters Derry need an immediate bounce against an improving Dundalk side, unbeaten at home but yet to win away this season. Drogheda United v Finn Harps Head in the Game Park, 7.45 Following an encouraging unbeaten six-match run, four straight defeats has dragged Drogheda into the relegation mix. A win for Harps would lift them over Drogheda and out of the bottom two for the first time since the opening night of the season. St Patrick’s Athletic v Shelbourne Richmond Park, 7.45 Shelbourne arrive for this Dublin derby searching for a third successive win as manager Damien Duff completes a three-match sideline suspension. A win to back up away draws at Derry and Sligo could enable St Patrick’s regain third place.
