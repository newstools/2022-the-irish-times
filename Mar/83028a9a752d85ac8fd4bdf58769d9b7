The White House said on Sunday that Mr Biden would hold a bilateral meeting with Mr Martin and receive a presentation of shamrock on March 17th, “continuing a longstanding St Patrick’s Day tradition”. “The leaders will reaffirm the close and historic partnership between the United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our people. They will discuss their countries’ contributions to the international effort to support the people of Ukraine and to impose costs on Russia for its unprovoked and unjustified war. “They will also talk about a range of global issues and shared priorities, including combatting the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide, strengthening global health security, tackling the climate crisis, and working together on the United Nations Security Council. ” US vice president Kamala Harris will host the Taoiseach for a breakfast at the Naval Observatory in Washington on St Patrick’s Day.
