Shane Lowry has told the PGA and DP World Tours that he has no intention of joining the Saudi-backed Super Golf League. The Offaly man, speaking to the media ahead of this week’s Honda Classic, looked to quash rumours that he’d been offered a contract to be involved in the proposed SGL. “I have never really said anything about it because no one has ever asked me,” explained the former British Open champion. “But the way I see it, the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour have given me and my family a life I never thought I would have and I am grateful for that. I am solely focused on trying to win more PGA Tour events, more DP World Tour events and more Majors. “I want to try and play in the next Ryder Cup and win that back and do stuff like that. So that’s where I am at in my career and that’s it really. I am committed to Europe and the PGA Tour. I have had some of the greatest times of my life on the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour and at the Ryder Cup last year and that’s going to be the case going forward.” As well as looking to end speculation that he’d agreed a deal to join the controversial breakaway league, Lowry also looked to explain why he took part in the recent Saudi International tournament. “It didn’t really sit well with me . . . I signed a deal after The Open in 2019 to play three years in a row when the Saudi International was a European Tour event. It just so happens that my deal ran into this year, and I had to play this year as well, so that’s the reason I was there.” When asked if he’d been approached by either Tour over his future plans, Lowry explained: “I wasn’t approached by anybody. But it was when I saw my name thrown around a couple of times, I actually went to them (the PGA Tour) on Monday.”
