Aviva’s fund management unit has less than 0.1% exposure to Russia and the British insurer is planning to sell it, chief executive Amanda Blanc said on Wednesday. “We have a very, very minimal exposure to Russia via Aviva Investors...less than 0.1,” Ms Blanc told a media call. “We will be divesting of that exposure as soon as we practically can.” -The insurer on Wednesday reported a 10 per cent drop in 2021 operating profit and said will return £4.75 billion to shareholders. Aviva had previously said it would give back at least £4 billion to investors following a string of disposals. Activist investor Cevian has sought £5billion in a cash return by the end of 2022. Aviva has raised £7.5 billion from selling eight businesses across the globe since the appointment of Ms Blanc as chief executive in July 2020. “We’ve achieved a lot in the last year but we’re only just getting started,” Ms Blanc said in a statement. Aviva said on Wednesday it was buying adviser Succession Wealth for £385 million. It upgraded its cost savings target to £750 million for the 2018-24 period. Cevian had been pushing Aviva to cut costs more aggressively. Operating profit from continuing operations was £1.63 billion, hurt by weaker performance in the insurer’s UK life business. Aviva said it would pay a total 2021 dividend of 22.05 pence per share, and expected a 40% increase in 2022 dividend to around 31.5 pence. – Reuters
