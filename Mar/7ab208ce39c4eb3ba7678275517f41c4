Liverpool’s contract talks with Mohamed Salah have broken down and the forward will not sign a new deal unless offered improved terms. Salah’s preference remains to stay at Anfield but he and his agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, have dismissed the club’s most recent offer and no talks have been held since December. On Friday Abbas posted seven laughing emojis on Twitter in apparent response to comments by Jürgen Klopp in a press conference. The manager had said: “I think Mo definitely expects this club to be ambitious and we are. It’s Mo’s decision. The club did what it can do. It is all fine. All fine from my point of view. Nothing has happened further, no signing, no rejection, we just have to wait. Completely fine, no rush.” Liverpool regard December’s offer as a good proposal but Salah does not believe it matches his worth. His contract runs to 2023, meaning that if no resolution is found soon Liverpool will face a choice between cashing in on him or keeping him in the hope of striking a deal while running the risk of losing him on a free. Salah is happy at Liverpool and under Klopp and said in January he was “not asking for crazy stuff”. He said he was looking for a show of appreciation for what he has done and spelled out: “It’s in their hands. They know what I want.” The Egypt international, who will be 30 in June, would be happy to continue in the Premier League if he ends up leaving Liverpool. - Guardian
