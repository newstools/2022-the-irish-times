Shannon Airport is projecting passenger numbers to more than triple to 1.33 million this year. The projection to return to 77 per cent of 2019 pre-Covid passenger numbers is contained in new tender documentation for a €5 million concession contract to operate four restaurant, cafe and bar outlets at the airport. The 1.33 million passenger estimate follows 379,935 passengers at Shannon during 2021, when pandemic restrictions were in place. The contract is due to begin in November of this year and continue for five years, with an option for a further two-year extension. Shannon Airport Authority (SAA) is inviting tenders to operate a landside restaurant and bar currently trading as JJ Ruddles; an airside bar and restaurant currently trading as The Sheridan Bar; an airside restaurant and food court currently trading as Zest At! and an airside cafe past the post-US customs and border protection site currently trading as Harry’s @ 8. The tender states: “SAA’s business strategy, which initially focused on stabilisation during Covid, is now firmly in recovery and rebuilding. SAA is committed to maximising all opportunities to build back stronger.” The current operator of the outlets is Zest at Limited, which can tender for the new contract.
