The Republic’s “bad bank” will wind up its operations in 2025, the organisation confirmed on Thursday. National Asset Management Agency (Nama) confirmed it would €4.9 billion for the Exchequer over its lifetime. Nama, established 12 years ago to aid the Republic’s banks following a financial crash, plans to finally wind up its operations by the end of December 2025. The agency said it has submitted a plan to the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, for this. Over the next three years, Nama will funding 1,800 new homes, prepare key residential building sites for sale and transfer its social housing operation to the Land Development Agency. The agency published its annual report on Thursday, showing it a €195 million post-tax profit last year. Nama is boosting the forecast surplus that it will pay to the State to €4.5 billion from its previous €4.25 billion projection. Adding in the €400 million tax that it has paid on profits to date, this will bring its total lifetime payout to the Exchequer to €4.9 billion, Nama said on Thursday. Nama intends transferring €500 million to the State this year, bringing the total surplus handed over so far to €3.5 billion. By the end of last month, the agency had generated a total of €47 billion over its lifetime. It has had no debts since repaying the last of its €31.8 billion liabilities in March 2020. Brendan McDonagh, Nama chief executive, said 2021′s profit was the result of long-term strategies implemented over the organisation’s lifetime. “It is our eleventh year of profitability in a row but the size of our profit is remarkable in the context of the late stage of our operations and the much smaller portfolio that we are now managing,” he added. Paschal Donohoe, Minister for Finance, welcomed the news. “I am pleased to note the increase of €250 million to Nama’s projected lifetime surplus, now forecast to be €4.5 billion,” he said.
