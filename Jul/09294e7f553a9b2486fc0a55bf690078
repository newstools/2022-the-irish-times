Sir, – The usually astute Newton Emerson overlooks a crucial factor in the Scottish National Party’s ability to attract undiminished electoral support despite what he calls its “intellectual collapse” and the “hubris” of its 15 years in government (“SNP’s travails”, Opinion & Analysis, June 30th). It is that there are very many people in Scotland who think above all else that Scotland should be independent (like Ireland) and that voting for the SNP is the surest way to achieve this. Whether or not the SNP is governing badly is immaterial to them. After independence, they would feel free to vote for whichever of the other parties they think will best manage Scotland’s affairs. – Yours, etc, CJ WOODS, Celbridge, Co Kildare.
