Sir, – Ronan McGreevy’s recent report on “the oldest and most important extant manuscript in the Irish language”, is pleasant news to all interested in our history and culture (”Book of Leinster, a ‘snapshot of the Middle Ages’, to be restored”, News, June 10th). Few people know about the largest collection of ancient Irish manuscripts kept in the manuscript library of the monastery of St Gall in Switzerland. These treasures arrived there during the 9th century, saved by Irish monks fleeing Viking plunderers. The Pangur Ban inscription penned in ancient Irish is one of these. About 40 years ago the library rebound its treasures. To everyone’s surprise they discovered that the vellum covers were actually the illuminated pages penned by Irish monks over 1,200 years ago and turned inside out as book covers. May I suggest that our Government negotiate with the Swiss authorities the donation of some of these manuscripts. Perhaps the Bank of America might also finance the digitalisation of these historic treasures. - Is mise, le meas, DERMOT CARTHY, Clontarf, Dublin 3.
