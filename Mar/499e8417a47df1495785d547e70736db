Ireland’s Stephanie Meadow claimed the sixth top 10 finish of her career after a final round 70 at the JTBC Classic in California. She finished 10-under-par overall, six strokes off Atthaya Thitikul and Denmark’s Nanna Koerstz Madsen who contested a playoff. Thai 19-year-old Thitikul defeated Madsen on the second playoff hole to win her first LPGA Tour title. Meadow picked up $29,038 (€26,422) for her efforts. Leona Maguire paid the price for a disappointing front nine - which included double bogeys on the fifth and eighth holes - closing with a two over par 74. That left her four under overall. Thitikul fired an eight-under-par 64 in the final round to catch Madsen and force the playoff. It was the lowest round at Aviara Golf Club all week. Madsen entered Sunday with a three-stroke lead but only managed a two-under 70. Her birdie at the Par 5 17th hole moved her into sole possession of the lead at 17 under, but she bogeyed the 18th to fall back into a tie with Thitikul at 16 under. They replayed the 18th hole twice. After both parred the first time through, Madsen’s second shot on the second playoff hole found the water, leading her to a double bogey. Thitikul tapped in a short bogey putt to win, becoming the youngest winner on tour since Canadian star Brooke Henderson won the 2016 Cambria Portland Classic as an 18-year-old. Rookie “Anyone (who comes) here, they want to win,” Thitikul said. “I want to win as well, but didn’t expect (it would) come really fast, in my rookie year as well. It’s just crazy in my mind right now. I cannot believe that I became an LPGA winner.” Thitikul’s round featured nine birdies and just one bogey. Five birdies came on the back nine, including at the 16th and 17th. It was just the fifth start of Thitikul’s rookie season, though the youngster had previous success in Europe, winning Player of the Year honours on the Ladies European Tour last season. Madsen earned her maiden win on tour at the Honda LPGA Thailand earlier this month and was vying for back-to-back titles. “It wasn’t a very good playoff,” Madsen said. “Yeah, I played a good week and I’m happy with the game. I could have maybe have done a little better today, but it was what I could do.” Na Rin An of South Korea carded a final-round 68 to finish 15 under, alone in third. Thailand’s Pajaree Anannarukarn, Canada’s Maude-Aimee Leblanc and world No. 1 Jin Young Ko of South Korea all shot 68 and tied for fourth at 14 under. Charley Hull (69) was seventh at 12 under, and defending champion Inbee Park of South Korea (68) and Lilia Vu (70) tied for eighth at 11 under.
