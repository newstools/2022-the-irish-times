Ulster have confirmed the signing of Munster outhalf Jake Flannery ahead of next season. The Tipperary-born 22-year-old leaves his native province after making four senior appearances. Game time has proved difficult to come by for Flannery with Joey Carbery, Ben Healy and Jack Crowley all ahead of him in the pecking order for the ‘10’ shirt. Flannery was part of the 2019 Grand Slam winning Ireland U20s squad and he moves north to Belfast on a one-year deal. The outhalf spoke of his excitement ahead of his move. “I’m excited to be joining Ulster Rugby” he said. “They’ve got a really exciting back line and play a style which I feel I can excel in. I leave Munster grateful for all the people who have helped me develop and grow. “I have high ambitions and I think Ulster Rugby will help me to strive for these.”
