Telecommunications company Eir has said 5G roaming is now available for customers travelling within the UK. In addition to 5G roaming availability in the UK, Eir customers travelling to Portugal, France, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Netherlands and Thailand will also now have access to high-speed 5G connectivity as they roam. Eir chief executive Oliver Loomes said: “Travel demand has increased dramatically in recent weeks and so I am pleased to announce the expansion of Eir’s 5G roaming network to include the UK and other highly popular travel destinations within Europe and Asia. “Our 5G customers who plan to travel this year will have access to the fastest and strongest technology available, ensuring they can stay in touch with family and friends while travelling the world.” Eir’s 5G network now extends across 1,250 sites in 450 towns and cities in Ireland. Eir has built and is expanding Ireland’s largest 5G network. In November last year, the company announced 5G availability across all mobile plans, ensuring customers could experience this next generation technology with unrivalled connectivity speeds.
