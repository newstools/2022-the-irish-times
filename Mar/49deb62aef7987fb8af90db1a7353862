Madrid clubs stand in the way of two Premier League teams’ Champions League hopes after Chelsea drew Real Madrid and Manchester City landed Atlético in the quarter-final draw. Liverpool were handed a more straightforward-looking assignment against Benfica, with the first leg in Lisbon, and Villarreal play Bayern Munich in the other tie. With the semi-final draw also made on Friday, it emerged that the winners of the ties involving the Madrid clubs will face one another for a place in the final, raising the possibility of an all-Premier League or all-Madrid clash. Chelsea and City play their quarter-final first legs at home. A tie against Real Madrid brings Chelsea, the holders, up against their former manager Carlo Ancelotti, who led his team to victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the previous round. Atlético will face City having beaten Manchester United in the last 16, a 1-1 draw in Madrid being followed by their 1-0 victory at Old Trafford. Benfica reached the quarter-finals by knocking out Ajax, a 1-0 win in Amsterdam securing the tie 3-2 on aggregate. Benfica are a distant third in the Portuguese league but are on an eight-game unbeaten run. The quarter-final first legs are scheduled for 5th-6th April, with the returns a week later.
