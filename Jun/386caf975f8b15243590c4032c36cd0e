The Government plans to introduce a 20c tax on all single-use takeaway coffee cups in a bid to make Ireland the first country in the world to eliminate their use. The so-called ‘latte levy’ forms part of the Circular Economy Bill, which aims to introduce world-leading moves to reduce waste and influence behaviour. Nearly half a million takeaway cups are sent to landfill or incineration every day. So why do some claim that the proposal won’t achieve its aims? In today’s episode of the Inside Business podcast, we hear from Dairine Keogh, owner of the Clement and Pekoe coffee shops in Dublin, about her views on the tax. Presenter Laura Slattery also speaks to managing director of Retail Excellence, Duncan Graham, and Sadhbh O’Neill, an assistant professor at Dublin City University and lecturer in climate policy and environmental politics.
