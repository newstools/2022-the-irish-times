Built in 2000 on the site of a convalescent home, Linden Court is a very finely sited apartment complex on Grove Avenue, a quiet suburban street that is closer to Stillorgan village than to Blackrock. It is situated on about nine acres of very mature grounds whose landscaping was improved with new planting just over 20 years ago, so there is a fine layering of old and new woodlands. Central to the scheme is a fine three-storey period property dating from 1874. Several of the new buildings have been set around this. In total there are 12 blocks comprising some 185 two- and three-bedroom apartments, penthouses and a couple of large five-bedroom houses. All are set round landscaped courtyards with water fountains at their centres. Apartment 14 is a generous second-floor unit in house 3 that will suit traders-down hoping to stay in the area. Smartly appointed and extending to 73sq m (789sq ft), it also has two balconies. The big draw will be the south-facing balcony which is off the sitting area and overlooks an internal courtyard. The covered balcony extends to just over 6sq m. On the days when it isn’t warm enough to venture outside, a wall-mounted gas fire in the sitting room offers another focal point. Off this is a small kitchen of about 6sq m with units set in a C-shape. The layout is clever and is designed to give anyone cohabiting a greater sense of privacy, for its two bedrooms are at either end of the property. The main bedroom has an en suite bathroom with a window, and a private balcony that will get some morning light. This means the second double could have exclusive use of the main, internal bathroom. Agent Janet Carroll is seeking €475,000 for the property, which has a Ber of C2 and an annual management fee of about €2,991.
