Medical packaging firm Amcor is to invest in a new thermoforming packaging capability at its Sligo facility, creating 75 jobs in the process. The multi-million-euro investment is expected to double the revenue of the site and increase its footprint. The company said it would also strengthen Amcor’s leadership in the growing industry for sterile packaging. “The significant investment in our Sligo site showcases the confidence in the outstanding expertise and dedication of our people,” John McSharry, plant general manager, Amcor Flexibles Sligo, said. “ Over the coming weeks and months, we will be advertising new roles and look forward to welcoming new colleagues and growing our great team,” he said. Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Development Leo Varadkar said: “Congratulations to the team at Amcor on this really significant expansion which will create 75 new jobs for Sligo.” “ This investment is a real vote of confidence in Sligo, the strong talent pool we have in the area and the existing team at the facility,” he said.
