1 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. 2 Place all of the ingredients for the meatballs into the bowl of a food processor and blitz until evenly combined. 3 Using wet hands, shape tablespoons of the meat into 20-25 balls. Arrange evenly on a large baking tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through until cooked through. I usually thread these on skewers for novelty and ease. 4 Meanwhile, make the crema. Blitz the avocado, sour cream, lime juice, coriander and salt until smooth and creamy. Set aside. 5 Mix all of the salsa ingredients until combined. Taste for seasoning and set aside. 6 Serve the meatballs right away with warm soft tortillas, the avocado crema and the salsa.
