Family-owned food business Killowen Farm is spending €4 million on an expansion that will create 25 new jobs. Killowen is best-known for the yogurt the Co Wexford farm makes from milk produced by its own cows, which it exports as far away as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The company said on Thursday that it planned a €4 million expansion, part-aided by a grant from State body, Enterprise Ireland, that would allow it increase cream cheese production. Killowen confirmed that the move would boost worker numbers by 25 to 72 from 47. Nicholas Dunne, chief executive, described the investment as significant. “This expansion would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the entire team at Killowen Farm, particularly over the past two challenging years,” he said. Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who attended the announcement, dubbed Killowen “real Irish success story”. Stephen Creaner, executive director, Enterprise Ireland, said the expansion was a huge milestone for Killowen.
