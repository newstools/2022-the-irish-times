Sir, – President Michael D Higgins’s opinion piece “We cannot let famine in the Horn of Africa slip from our agenda” (June 28th) is a clear call to action for a renewed effort to prevent the deaths of millions of people at risk of widespread famine. Irish aid agencies working in the region have come together to sound the alarm on a catastrophic hunger crisis that is affecting more than 23 million people. Together, we are appealing to the Government to demonstrate and hold firm leadership at an international level to ensure an immediate and radical mobilisation of aid in the region. Rich nations, including our own, must meet the drastically underfunded UN appeal for Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia to help save lives now. Ireland can play a leading role by being an outspoken advocate at the UN Security Council for decision making that protects the lives and wellbeing of those who are left furthest behind and disproportionately impacted by climate change, food insecurity and conflict. In President Higgins’s words, “Globally, we have the capacity to anticipate and prevent regional and global famines, giving meaning to the words ‘never again’. The transformation we need is possible and overdue.” For the 350,000 Somali children who are risk of death this summer, tackling this hunger crisis must be an urgent and imminent priority. Each day of delay is costing lives. – Yours, etc, SARAH O’TOOLE, Chairperson, Dóchas – The Irish Network for International Development and Humanitarian Organisations, Dublin 8.
