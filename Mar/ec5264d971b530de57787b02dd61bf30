The IRFU have confirmed that Andrew Porter has been ruled out of Ireland’s remaining 2022 Six Nations games away to England and at home to Scotland due to the ankle injury he sustained in the win over Italy. “Following a scan on his injured ankle, Andrew Porter has been ruled out of the remainder of our #GuinnessSixNations campaign,” the Union revealed on Twitter. “He has returned to @LeinsterRugby and his medical treatment will be managed by the Leinster Medical Team.” The loss of the in-form, all-action 26-year-old loosehead is a serious blow for Ireland in the setpiece and around the pitch. Although the IRFU statement did not reveal the exact nature or extent of the injury, it is believed that it is not season threatening and Porter is hopeful of recovering in time for Leinster’s Heineken Champions Cup round of 16 first leg away to Connacht, which would be five weeks since the Italian game. Porter’s unavailability compounds the loss of first-choice hooker Rónan Kelleher, who was also ruled out of the remainder of the Six Nations due to the shoulder injury he suffered during the round two clash with France. It seems likely that David Kilcoyne and Cian Healy will both be involved against England at Twickenham on Saturday week, and although Ireland have not formally called up another loosehead to their Six Nations squad in place of Porter, the probability is that either Leinster’s Ed Byrne or Ulster’s Eric O’Sullivan will be added.
