A potential Croke Park rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano has been ruled out for this year after the Irish boxer’s promoter Eddie Hearn suggested that the Serrano camp turned down the offer of a second bout. Following the Bray boxer’s historic win via a split decision at Madison Square Garden in April, strong suggestions were made that a return bout could be held in Ireland, with Croke Park touted as a possible location. Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing held talks with the GAA venue with sights set on a fight taking place next autumn. However, comments made by Hearn to Pro Boxing Fans seem to suggest the possibility of Taylor fighting on home soil for the first time in her professional career - security concerns around boxing events in Ireland have prevented this up until now - are dead in the water. “They don’t want that fight, unfortunately,” revealed Hearn. “I mean we’ve spoken to (Serrano’s promoter) Jake Paul’s team and they don’t want to go to Ireland. They don’t really want the rematch. It’s kind of like, regardless of the offer, ‘we don’t want to do the rematch’.” “It’s very disappointing, because I love that fight and I think it’s a great fight and such a close fight. It doesn’t look like it’s a fight that unfortunately Amanda Serrano wants.”
