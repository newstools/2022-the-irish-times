Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital on Wednesday pulled the publication of its 2021 results after auditors PwC told the digital advertising group they were not able to complete the work in time. S4, a digital advertising company, said it believed the results remained within the range of market expectations and it continued to trade strongly in the first two months of 2022. “The company will release its preliminary results for 2021 as soon as PwC have completed their work,” it said. S4 Capital was built by Mr Sorrell, the world’s most famous advertising executive, after he left global market leader WPP, which he had founded and run for more than 30 years. – Reuters
