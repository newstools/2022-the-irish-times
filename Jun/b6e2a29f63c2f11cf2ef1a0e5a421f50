Sir, – I am writing to you to bring some attention to the case of adult literacy tutors nationally. We are a group of about 3,500 tutors who work in the further education sector of Education and Training Boards. Although our working colleagues engage in similar work, they have much better terms and conditions. In fact, we are the only teaching staff in further education that do not have proper terms and conditions. We are laid off for 14 weeks every year. Ironically, our work involves teaching the most marginalised in society and yet we ourselves are marginalised by our employer. On June 30th, the Department of Further Education, Education and Training Boards Ireland and unions are having a meeting to discuss our future. Our fate is out of our hands. All we want is to be treated equally and fairly and not be taken advantage of by our employer. – Yours, etc, SUSAN WALSH, Ballyshannon, Co Donegal.
