Leinster prop Peter Dooley will make his 100th appearance for the province and his first start of the 2021/22 campaign against Benetton Rugby at Stadio Monigo in the URC on Saturday (kick-off at 12.55pm Irish time - live on RTÉ, Premier Sports and URC TV). The Offaly native made his debut for Leinster against Edinburgh Rugby in October 2014. The following season he played 21 times and has been an integral part of the squad since. Dooley is linked with a move to Connacht at the end of the season. He’ll be joined in the frontrow in Italy by Seán Cronin and Thomas Clarkson. Joe McCarthy retains his spot in the secondrow and he’s joined by Ross Molony who returns after spending time with the Ireland squad last week. Rhys Ruddock, Scott Penny and Max Deegan complete the pack. Captain for the trip to Treviso is scrumhalf Luke McGrath who is partnered by Ross Byrne in the halfbacks. Once more, Cullen and Co have opted for Harry Byrne and Jamie Osborne in the midfield while both Jordan Larmour and Jimmy O’Brien start having also returned from international duty for the tie. Last week’s player of the match Tommy O’Brien will line out on the left wing. Among the replacements, James Tracy, Ed Byrne, Michael Ala’alatoa, Devin Toner, Dan Leavy, Cormac Foley, Rory O’Loughlin and Dave Kearney will all be hoping to make an impact. LEINSTER: Jimmy O’Brien; Jordan Larmour, Jamie Osborne, Harry Byrne, Tommy O’Brien; Ross Byrne, Luke McGrath (capt); Peter Dooley, Seán Cronin, Thomas Clarkson; Ross Molony, Joe McCarthy; Rhys Ruddock, Scott Penny, Max Deegan.
