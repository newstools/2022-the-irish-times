Leona Maguire finished the first round of the LPGA Thailand seven shots off the lead after carding an opening 70, good for two under. While the Cavan woman completed a blemish free round, only one further birdie was added to one on the opening hole on a day of low scoring across the board. Australian Su Oh, Japan’s Nasa Hataoka and German Esther Henseleit share the first-round lead after carding 9-under 63s at Siam Country Club. All three went 18 holes without a bogey in Chonburi, Thailand. China’s Xiyu Lu sits one shot back at eight under. World number nine Henseleit had nine birdies in her first round in the event. Hataoka hit all 18 greens and all 14 fairways and said she’s more comfortable than ever in her fourth appearance in the event. “(This is the) first time we know the golf course, so I know the bad position and good position,” Hataoka said. “I missed the bad position, so that’s why I play really good today.” Oh also shot the lowest round of her competitive career on Thursday, capped with a downhill putt for par to close out the first round. “I would have been so (angry) if I missed,” Oh said with a laugh. “I think my ball striking was actually better last week, but I had like 10 less putts this week ... today,” said Oh, who needed only 22 putts Thursday. “And I didn’t hit it that much closer. I think I hit it closer last week, but just didn’t hole anything. So I’m glad I holed some putts today. Feels really nice.” Six players are tied for fifth at seven under, including Canadian Brooke Henderson and France’s Celine Boutier, who is of Thai descent. Defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand finished with a 74.
