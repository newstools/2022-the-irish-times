Sir, – As we approach the centenary of the general election of June 16th, 1922, it is worth reflecting on the significance of this historic event in the context of centenary celebrations. To date, much comment has centered on the need for sensitivity when debating the key events of 1922, in particular in relation to the outbreak of a violent Civil War, which event left a dire legacy of bitterness that divided our people over many decades. Sensitivity, however, should not obscure significant facts. On January 7th, 1922, the Treaty was passed by a majority of seven in Dáil Éireann. Six months later, in the general election of June 16th, 78 per cent of seats were won by candidates who supported the Treaty, a very substantial majority, representing the democratic will of the people. This incontrovertible fact is too often overlooked in public discourse, its significance too often relegated to a dismissive one-line comment such as “not everyone accepted the election result”. In your editorial of January 3rd, “The Irish Times view on a decade of centenaries: Remembering the Civil War”, commenting on the significant historical events of 1922, you acknowledged that “the general election of 1922 is often an overlooked event in the life of the State”. A similar view is expressed by Ronan McGreevy writing in your Century: 1922 Civil War supplement in May when he opines that “the 1922 general election has never received the same attention as the 1918 or 1932 general elections”. Surely, a century on from the 1922 election, it is time to accord the significance it merits to such a momentous event in the history of our country. – Yours, etc, MÁIRE WHITE. Kinlough, Co Leitrim.
