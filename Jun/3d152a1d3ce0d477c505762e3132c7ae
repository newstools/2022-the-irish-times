This week, two members of the Pinot family, from different regions of New Zealand. Both are available from Lidl and represent good value for money. Gisborne, on the east coast of the New Zealand’s North Island, is one of the country’s historic wine regions. Made from Pinot Gris (otherwise known as Pinot Grigio), this is a rich, textured wine with melon and pear fruits. Try this with milder creamy Asian curries and prawn salads. Marlborough is best known for Sauvignon Blanc, but the region is producing increasingly good Pinot Noir. This one has juicy, light, very gluggable red cherry and strawberry fruits. Try this with seared tuna, grilled duck breast or mushroom risotto.
