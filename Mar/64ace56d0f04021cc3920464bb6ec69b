The run-up to St Patrick’s Day generally sees a slew of new whiskey releases and 2022 is no exception. The much-anticipated launch of the 2022 Midleton Very Rare Vintage took place in late February. This is the second release assembled by master distiller Kevin O’Gorman and his team, and the 39th in the series from Midleton. A smooth and elegant whiskey with complex toffee apples, burnt orange peel, caramel and spices finishing on a woody note. Midleton Very Rare 2022 (€200) is available in limited quantities from specialist retailers. Teeling Distillery, located in the heart of Dublin, and open again to visitors, recently released the fifth and final whiskey in the Renaissance Series: an 18-Year- Old Single Malt as before, but on this occasion finished in ex-Calvados casks. The result is a delicious whiskey, floral with baked orchard fruits and hints of caramel; €140 per bottle. Dark chocolate Teeling has also launched the third in its Vintage Reserve Collection series. Just 750 bottles of the 32-year-old single malt were released. Aged in rum and PX Sherry casks, this superb whiskey carries a massive intensity of rich textured raisins, figs and molasses overlaid with dark chocolate. Sadly, it will set you back €2,000 for a bottle. Lastly, Glendalough launched a new version of its seven-year-old single malt, this release finished in Mizunara oak. Mizunara is a very expensive, rare and highly sought-after Japanese oak that imparts unique spicy notes, including sandalwood, vanilla and coconut. It has taken the team a huge effort to source the Mizunara; it is also a difficult wood to work with. The resulting whiskey is exquisite. It is available for €85 a bottle from specialist retailers and from glendaloughdistillery.com.
