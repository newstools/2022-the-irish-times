Sir, – Fianna Fail backbenchers are feeling rudderless and disjointed from their leadership (Jennifer Bray, “Fianna Fáil backbenchers rise up, but Taoiseach is not in their crosshairs – for now”, Analysis, July 8th). At least they have a craft to hang onto, unlike the general public, whose ship has sailed a long time ago without them. – Yours, etc, ELIZABETH LEVINE, Celbridge, Co Kildare.
