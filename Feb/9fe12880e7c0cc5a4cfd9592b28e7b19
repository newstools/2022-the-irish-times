Michael Hoey has announced his retirement from professional golf to become a referee on the DP World Tour. Hoey, a five-time winner on the European Tour and part of the victorious Walker Cup team in 2001, will begin his new role in South Africa next month as a referee. “It’s exciting, a new challenge,” the 43-year-old from Ballymoney told BBC Sport. “When the pandemic started in 2020 I started learning the rules and looking into that as I didn’t really know where the future lay. “I missed that whole year but had quite a good year last year and did quite well at the Dunhill Links so I proved to myself I could still play. “But I’ve just turned 43 and I see so many good young players on the Challenge Tour now, it’s hard to make a living. “I’ll always miss the thrill of competition but I’ve had two years to think about this and while I enjoyed it last year, you have to make a living out of it too and I’m happy with where I am.”
