Former Argentina rugby international Federico Aramburu died in Paris after being shot during a dispute in the early hours of Saturday, according to reports. L’Equipe said Aramburu, who won 22 caps for Argentina, had been involved in an altercation in a bar shortly before dawn. He was shot on the upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain soon afterwards, the paper added. Aramburu, who played club rugby at Biarritz, Perpignan, Dax and Glasgow, was 42. Agence France Presse said a murder investigation had been opened, quoting the Paris prosecutor’s office. Paris police confirmed to Reuters there had been a heated argument in a bar in Paris’s 6th arrondissement, on the Left Bank of the river Seine. The rowing parties separated before the assailants returned in a car and opened fire, a police spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed one person had been killed but said he was not aware of the victim’s identity. Glasgow Warriors paid tribute to their former player on Twitter: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden and tragic death of Warrior #185, Federico Aramburu. “The embodiment of a true Warrior and much-loved by all, the thoughts of everyone past and present at the club, are with his family at this immensely difficult time.”
