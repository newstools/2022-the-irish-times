Krispy Kreme has toned down and reduced the size of its corporate signage for its first Dublin City centre outlet in a bid to get the green light for the opening of the store. The US-owned doughnut company was due to open its Central Plaza unit on Dame Street “circa Christmas 2021” subject to planning permission for the signage attached to the restaurant. However, the council last November sought additional information on the scheme, after a planning report found the council had “serious reservations” regarding the visual impact of the signage. The report also pointed out that the permission for the unit is for restaurant/cafe and the drawings appeared to suggest the premises may be used mainly as a takeaway service. John Gannon, director at planning consultants Tom Phillips + Associates, told the council that there is seating for 40 customers inside the premises with a further 20 customers outside. ‘Less garish’ Mr Gannon said Krispy Kreme may add an additional six covers internally following the initial opening period, when a large volume of customer traffic is anticipated. The council planner’s report also required the Krispy Kreme signage to be “more mannerly and less garish”. Krispy Kreme has since lodged revised plans for smaller signage. The main brand sign on one side of the outlet is reduced by 25 per cent, Mr Gannon said, while the company also proposes to refine the colours, resulting in a more muted palette than is the norm for the company’s corporate branding. Mr Gannon argued that the revised proposed signage will not in any way compromise the visual setting of either the refurbished building or the adjoining plaza. The opening of Krispy Kreme’s first store in Ireland in Blanchardstown in September 2018 resulted in long queues of about 300 people from 7am on its first day.
