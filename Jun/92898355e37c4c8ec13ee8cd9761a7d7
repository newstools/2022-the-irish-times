1 Drain the can of chickpeas and shake dry in a sieve. 2 Place the sieve with the chickpeas inside a barbecue, over the indirect heat and smoke for 30 minutes. 3 Wrap the garlic in tinfoil along with a drizzle of olive oil and roast until soft and tender – about 15 minutes. 4 Allow the chickpeas and garlic to cool slightly then add to a blender along with the tahini, smoked paprika and lemon juice. Blitz together until smooth. 1 Add the flour, baking powder, yoghurt and a pinch of salt to a large bowl and mix together to form a shaggy dough. 2 Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about five minutes until smooth. Leave to rest for 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. 3 When ready, divide the dough into four and roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface to about ½cm thick. 4 Tie your herbs together with twine to form a herb brush. 5 Arrange the flatbreads on the grill and cook over a high heat for four minutes on each side, using the herb brush to brush your flatbreads with butter as you grill. 1 Cut the aubergine into discs and season with olive oil, salt and pepper. 2 Grill over a medium heat until tender and cooked through (six minutes each side). 1 Cut the courgettes down the middle like a log. Season with olive oil, salt and pepper. 2 Grill flesh side down until you've got a nice char on the courgettes (about six minutes), then turn them and sprinkle over the Parmesan. Cook for a further six minutes. Remove from the grill and slice. 1 Roughly chop the capers and walnuts. 2 Place the rocket into a bowl and add the capers and walnuts along with a drizzle of the juice from the jar of capers. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. 1 Take a flat bread and spread it with some smoked chickpea hummus. Add some charred veggies and top with a handful of the salad. Finish with a grating of Parmesan.
