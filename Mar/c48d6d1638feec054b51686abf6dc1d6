Connacht have announced the signing of New Zealand-born backrow Shamus Hurley-Langton from the Manawatu turbos. The number eight has made 18 appearances for Manawatu across the Mitre 10 Cup and NPC and spent time with the wider Hurricanes squad in Super Rugby. He can cover both flanker positions as well and is viewed as a powerful ball-carrying option, making him a good fit to replace the departing Abraham Papali’i. Andy Friend explained how Hurley-Langton has been on Connacht’s radar for some time. “We’ve been following Shamus for quite a while now” said the western province’s head coach. “He’s extremely powerful and offers us something a bit different to our other backrow options next season. “He’s still only 21 so has the potential to get even better, so we’re really looking forward to integrating him into the group and seeing what he can produce.” Despite his noticeable name, it is understood that Hurley-Langton is not Irish qualified.
