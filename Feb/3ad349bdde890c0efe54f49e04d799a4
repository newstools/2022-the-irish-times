Galway 3-22 Cork 2-17 Shane Walsh inspired Galway to a third successive victory in Division Two as they maintained a direct course for promotion at Pairc Ui Chaoimh on Saturday night. It was Cork’s third defeat and with only a point to their name from a draw with Clare, they are now firmly in the battle to avoid relegation - and all its consequences in terms of the new football championship. The sides were level at 1-12 apiece at the end of a breath-taking first-half with Blake Murphy goaling for Cork inside 90 seconds only for Wash to convert a seventh minute penalty. Galway swept four points clear with Robert Finnerty and Matthew Tierney also impressing before Cork replied with five unanswered scores as Steven Sherlock showed his prowess from frees. It was a different story on the resumption as Galway took control and but for a couple of outstanding saves by home goalkeeper Chris Kelly, they would have been in a more commanding position. But, they pounced twice in 90 seconds to surge into a winning position, when Damien Comer and Walsh slammed in unstoppable goals for a 3-16 to 1-15 lead after 54 minutes. Their advantage spread to 12 points approaching the end before Cork hit 1-1 in injury-time, with substitute Daniel O’Connell finishing off a fine move to score his side’s second goal.
