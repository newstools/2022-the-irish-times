Divock Origi is poised to join Milan when his Liverpool deal expires this summer. The forward has agreed the move and is waiting to take a medical and sign the contract. Origi has been at Liverpool since 2015 and has scored some notable goals, including two against Barcelona during the famous Champions League semi-final comeback at Anfield in 2019, a goal in that year’s Champions League final and the winner at home to Everton a year earlier. He has been unable to hold down a regular place, though, exemplified by starting two Premier League games over the past two seasons, and hopes to get more playing time at Milan. He spent the 2017-18 season on loan at Wolfsburg. The Belgium international has 22 goals from 107 Premier League games for Liverpool and could get a farewell appearance at home to Wolves on Sunday. Milan play at Sassuolo on Sunday knowing a win would guarantee them a first Serie A title since 2011. – Guardian
