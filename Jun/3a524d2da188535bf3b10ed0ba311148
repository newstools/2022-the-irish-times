Trespasses by Louise Kennedy is the latest book up for discussion on The Women’s Podcast Book Club. Set in Belfast during the Troubles, the story explores the relationship between Cushla Lavery, a Catholic school teacher living at home with her alcoholic mother, and Michael Agnew, an older and married Protestant barrister. So what did book clubbers Bernice Harrison, Niamh Towey, Róisín and Ann Ingle make of this debut novel? “This book, I felt left me with such a greater understanding of what it was like to be a human and living in Northern Ireland and in 1970s and I’m really thankful to the author for giving me that” Niamh Towey explains. The group also share their summer reading recommendations, which include Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty and People Person by Candice Carty-Williams.
