Seven teams of young advertising professionals have been selected to represent Ireland at Cannes Young Lions, a global competition set to take place ahead of the prestigious Cannes Lions creative festival in June, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland (IAPI) has announced. Roisin Jordan from the agency The Tenth Man and Raphael Da Silva from Rothco | Accenture Interactive, will represent Ireland in the design category, while Folk Wunderman Thompson duo Kim Comiskey and Derwin Myers will be the Irish team in the digital category and Rothco | Accenture Interactive editors Adam Kelly and Eoin Lennon will represent in film. Rothco | Accenture Interactive’s Róisín Monk and Laura Cassidy were selected in the media category, Emmet Heneghan and Steve Clifford from the same agency will compete in the print category, Edelman’s Aoife Cregan and Kate Stapleton will compete in the PR section and AIB digital content manager Adetunji Paul will represent in the young marketers’ competition. “Not only does this programme highlight young talent but it also benefits our chosen charities, who all receive a huge range of terrific concepts and fund-raising ideas for their cause,” said IAPI chief executive Charley Stoney. Charity campaigns The process to select Ireland’s entrants will see a film produced for Dublin Rape Crisis Centre courtesy of a sponsoring agency, Pull the Trigger, and aired without charge by Sky Ireland. DMG Media will run the winning press ad for Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, while entrants also devised PR and digital campaigns for another charity, the Open Community. Public relations bodies PRII/PRCA, Smurfit Kappa, marketing group Core, Facebook owner Meta and Radiocentre Ireland also acted as sponsors. The Irish stage of the competition – which was open to people born on or after June 24th, 1990 – was not held last year as the 2020 winners who saw their participation postponed by the Covid-19 crisis went on to represent Ireland in 2021. While IAPI will bring the seven teams to the festival in June as their prize, the international competition will this year take place remotely ahead of the Cannes Lions, as organisers decided this would be a fairer and more equitable approach in light of the pandemic.
