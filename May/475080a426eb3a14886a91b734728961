Government Covid-19 curbs left Shannon Airport’s passenger numbers trailing pre-pandemic totals by almost 80 per cent last year. The airport’s owner, Shannon Group, reported on Wednesday that it handled 380,000 passengers in 2021, 8 per cent more than the 352,000 it attracted in 2020. However, the company noted that last year’s total was still 78 per cent down on 2019, the year before the pandemic struck air travel. The Government only began easing the Republic’s tough travel restrictions last July, after most of the rest of Europe had reopened. Shannon Group chief executive Mary Considine said that the State company’s strategy was now focused on rebuilding rather than simply survival. Revenues at the company grew 18 per cent to €40.5 million last year from €34.3 million in 2020. Earnings before interest, tax and write-offs were €8.6 million. Ms Considine thanked the Government for the support Shannon Group received during 2021, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, meant to support jobs hit by the pandemic.
