AA Ireland has launched new podcast focussing on road safety, transport, motoring, home and travel. The AA Ireland Podcast will go out four times a month. The first few look at electric vehicles, the increasing cost of fuel at the pumps, the effect electric scooters are having on vulnerable road users. “We often commentate on transport matters in The AA, so it felt like a natural step for us to take our conversations to a longer format, with insight from some of the best guests across a variety of topics, with a heavy slant on motoring and transport,” said Paddy Comyn, AA Ireland head of communications. Co-host Anna Cullen said: “We hope to give a further voice to a variety of people across the spectrum about matters affecting road use and travel in Ireland.”
