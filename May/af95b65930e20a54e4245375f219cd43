Peace has broken out between the GAA and Gaelic Players Association after a couple of months of skirmishing over the issue of players’ expenses. The dispute erupted in March when it emerged that the players charter for 2022 had been unilaterally adopted by the GAA after the withdrawal of the GPA from discussions. Among the points of contention were player entitlements that had been suspended during the pandemic because of the lack of revenue that resulted. The GPA understood that as soon as restrictions were lifted there would be a reversion to the status quo ante, which they claimed was not forthcoming in the new charter. As a result players refused to co-operate with media engagements organised by the GAA’s main commercial partners with a view to exerting pressure on Croke Park. The resolution sees all issues concerning travel expenses settled and agreement on the 2022 charter with a provision for the negotiation of a new one for next year. The statement in full reads: “Subject to approval by the GAA’s Árd Chomhairle and the GPA’s national executive committee, who meet separately this week, the GAA and the players’ representative body can confirm that agreement has been reached on a players’ charter which will cover the 2022 season. “It has also been agreed after recent discussions that a new charter will be negotiated for 2023. All previously outstanding issues relating to travel expenses have been resolved. “The GAA and GPA are committed to working together in a positive way in an effort to avoid similar issues arising in the future. “
