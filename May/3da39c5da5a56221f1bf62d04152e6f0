Bernard Dunne has resigned from his role as the Irish Athletic Boxing Association’s (IABA) high performance director, it has been confirmed. Dunne had been on extended leave since the Tokyo Olympics. It comes as Dunne had lodged a complaint with the IABA CEO Fergal Carruth in November, saying his position had been undermined by an unsigned “SWOT Analysis Position Paper”, claimed to have been written after a survey on Irish boxing, that he considered highly damaging to his position. The former world champion took up the role in 2017 and oversaw a difficult period in Irish amateur boxing. He is the third high performance director lost to the IABA since Billy Walsh left in 2016.
