London Heathrow airport is capping the number of passengers it will handle for the next two months at 100,000  a day as it struggles to cope with resurgent air travel. Many Irish people use the British hub to transfer to flights bound for destinations not available from airports here. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow chief executive, says the airport cannot not serve any more than 100,000 people a day from Tuesday to September 11th, blaming a shortage of resources in key areas. Heathrow calculates that airlines have 104,000 seats a-day available on departing flights from there over the rest of the summer, potentially 4,000 more passengers daily than the airport can handle. However, Mr Holland-Kaye maintains that on average airlines have sold just 1,500 of these seats a-day over the next two months. “And so we are asking our airline partners to step selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers,” he said.
