So close, and yet so far. Shane Lowry rode the thin line between victor and vanquished in a final round of the RBC Heritage Classic at Harbour Town Golf Links at Hilton Head Island in South Carolina where, for the second straight week, he had to accept his fate of missing out and finishing in tied-third as Jordan Spieth went to extra holes to get the job done. For so much of the final round, after a shaky start, Lowry was streamlining his way towards a first tour win since his Claret Jug success of 2019 but, almost from nowhere, his fate was decided on the Par 3 14th hole where a poor tee shot into a waste area in the trees was followed by a pitch that saw his ball roll through the green and over the railway sleepers into the water. In running up a double bogey six, having gone 25 holes without dropping a shot, Lowry dropped from outright leader into one of those in pursuit of Jordan Spieth. Needing a birdie over his finishing holes to force his way into a play-off, Lowry salvaged a good par on the 15th before hitting a superb tee-shot on the Par 3 17th to 12 feet only to see his birdie putt stay left of the cup and above ground. A poor approach on the 18th effectively sealed his fate, as he found a bunker but at least managed to get up and down to save his par as a closing 69 for 12-under-par 272 left the Offalyman in tied-third place, a shot outside of the play-off fought out by Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Lowry, in fine form of late in claiming a third top-10 finish in his last six appearances on tour, had made his move on the front nine with a run of three successive birdies - on the fourth, fifth and sixth holes - to turn in 33 strokes and moved into the outright lead with a birdie on the 11th only for that Par 3 14th to prove his undoing after a pulled tee shot and, then, a chip shot that hit the green and ran on and on over the sleepers into the water. That double-bogey ultimately proved to be the destructive score on Lowry’s card, although to his credit he gave himself chances coming in without being able to convert. In the playoff, Spieth’s approach to the green - on the 18th - at the first play-off hole found a plugged lie but he managed to get up and down to save his par. Cantlay, also in a plugged lie, hit his bunker shot some 35 feet beyond the flag and failed to hole the putt as Spieth captured his first win since the Valero Texas Open some 13 months ago. It gave Spieth a 13th win on the PGA Tour, which - despite some poor putting through the tournament - also showcased his ability to get the job done: “Last week was really a killer for me, my favourite tournament (the Masters) and not getting to play the weekend, this feels amazing. I am a little lost for words. I won this golf tournament without a putter.” Graeme McDowell closed with a 68 for a total of eight-under-par 276, to finish in tied-21st position. On the LPGA Tour, South Korean Hyo Joo Kim closed with a 71 for a total of 11-under-par 277 to finish two strokes clear of Japan’s Hinako Shibuno to win the Lotte Championship in Hawaii. It was the 26-year-old’s fifth LPGA Tour career title. Unfortunately, it proved to be a disappointing closing round for Stephanie Meadow who had started in fourth place but signed for a 77 for 287, one-under, that dropped her to tied-18th place. “Not the Sunday I was looking for but proud of how I played the back today. Learning from my mistakes and ready to head to LA,” said Meadow on social media after her disappointing finish. Leona Maguire shot a 69 in the final round for 291 to finish in tied-48th position. Both Meadow and Maguire are in the field for this week’s DIO Implant Open at Wilshire Country Club in Los Angeles.
