Much as Pride is a moment of joy, these past few weeks and months have been marked by hurt and anger for many of those in the LGBTQ+ community. While rainbow flags and solidarity stickers are still visible up and down the country, it’s clear that there is still plenty of work to do before everyone can feel safe on our streets, let alone celebrated. The work of allyship is a year-round endeavour, and one which can never begin too early in life. As we like to say in our line of work, the best place to start can often be with a book. Last month, together with An Post, Children’s Books Ireland launched our Pride Reading Guide. The reading guide contains 100 LGBTQ+ inclusive titles, from baby books all the way up to young adult titles, and is available for free in libraries, bookshops and online. Here, I’ve selected 10 reviews from the guide, written by our expert team, that best convey the meaning of Pride. Filled with facts and history, inclusive characters and lots of joy, these books can be used as a both a starting point and a point of reference for these important conversations with young (and not so young) readers. Happy Pride, and happy reading!
