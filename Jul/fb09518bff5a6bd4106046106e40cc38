A mother has been sentenced to three months in prison for the manslaughter of her newborn baby. Waterford Circuit Court Judge Eugene O’Kelly said the baby, found dead in a Caredoc bin, was neglected, and left to die by the one and only person who knew of her birth, her mother. Judge O’Kelly said baby Sophie, who was born healthy, was denied a chance of a long and happy life. He made the comments during the sentencing hearing of the baby’s mother 23-year-old Caitlin Corcoran, formally of Mount Suir, Gracedieu, Waterford city and now of Castleblaney, Mullinavat, Co Kilkenny. Following a two-week trial last October, Ms Corcoran was found unanimously guilty of manslaughter of Sophie Elizabeth Corcoran on April 2nd, 2018 at Caredoc on the Cork Road, Waterford city. A majority verdict of guilty was returned for the child neglect charge on the same date. Addressing the court on behalf of his client, Paul W Hutchinson BL said losing her liberty on June 24th has a profound effect on Ms Corcoran, who suffered a panic attack in the aftermath. She has found the two weeks in prison demoralising and lonely as she has been treated as a vulnerable person and isolated 24/7 in her cell from the general prison population. She is limited to six-minute phone calls and is entitled to two visits per calendar month. Mr Hutchinson stated that a prison sentence would have a profound impact on his client. However, Judge Eugene O’Kelly said he could not comment on prison policy and said she had to be sentenced appropriately.
