European airports had little to time to prepare for governments’ lifting of Covid curbs or the surge in travel that followed, according to a leading aviation industry chief. Javier Marín, president of Airports Council International Europe (ACI), told the organisation’s conference on Thursday that demand for travel beat expectations while businesses in the sector struggled with labour shortages. Dublin Airport is racing to hire security officers as Irish people head overseas following two years of restrictions, while ground-handling and other service businesses also confess that they face staff shortages. Bottlenecks in airports across Europe, including London, Amsterdam and Paris, have forced airlines to cancel some flights. Asked if the industry could have been better prepared, Mr Marín said: “I honestly do not think so.” He argued that governments gave airports little notice of decisions to lift restrictions, so they had little time to ensure they had the resources to cope with increased demand for travel. Mr Marín noted that aviation was no longer considered to be as attractive an employer as it was in the past. “When you look at ground handling in particular, we have to find a better balance between competitiveness and the social sustainability of the employment on offer,” he said. Addressing the conference in Rome, Mr Marín pointed out that Irish regulators were among those seeking to keep airport charges low while expecting the facilities to invest. Dublin Airport owner DAA is seeking increases in passenger charges to pay for investment it says is needed for the future. “Any company must take the steps necessary to remain a viable business,” said Mr Marín. “As airlines are increasing their fares to passengers as they recover, so must airports be able to increase charges to their customers too.”
