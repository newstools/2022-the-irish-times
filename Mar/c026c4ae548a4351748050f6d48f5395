On Tuesday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an impassioned speech via video link to a packed out European Parliament. “We are fighting for our rights, our lives, our freedom,” he told MEPs. “Prove that you are with us, prove that you will not let us go, prove that you indeed are Europeans. And then life will win over death and light will win over darkness.” Zelenskiy’s speech followed his formal request, on Monday, that Ukraine’s application to join the European Union be fast-tracked. Meanwhile, satellite images showed a 60km convoy of Russian military vehicles approaching Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv, home to three million people. Irish Times journalist Dan McLaughlin, who is currently in Kyiv, spoke to some of the men and women taking up arms to defend Ukraine.
