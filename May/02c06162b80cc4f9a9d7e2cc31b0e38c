The National Treasury Management Agency has sold €1.25 billion in bonds at a scheduled auction. Two bonds were offered during the sale of long-term debt. The 10-year Treasury bond, which will mature in October 2032, raised €400 million. It was sold at a yield of 1.5 per cent, with a bid to cover ratio of 2.84. The remaining €800 million was raised through the sale of the 2 per cent Treasury bond, due to mature in February 2045. That was sold at a yield of 1.789 per cent, and had a bid to cover ratio of 1.41. Thursday’s auction brings to €5.75 billion the total in benchmark bonds sold so far in 2022. The NTMA is aiming to raise between €10 billion and €14 billion in the international bond markets this year, a significant reduction on the amount raised last year as the Government’s Covid-related spending eases.
