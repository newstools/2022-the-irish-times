Web Summit co-founder Paddy Cosgrave is facing fresh legal action after a former employee filed a defamation case against him. The latest case is in connection with a series of tweets posted by Mr Cosgrave in recent weeks making allegations about Mark O’Toole, who left Web Summit in 2015. The proceedings were lodged on Thursday by Mr O’Toole, represented by Lavelle Partners, in the High Court. Mr O’Toole worked with Web Summit in a public relations role for two years, before moving to Beachhut PR. He is currently vice-president of 150Bond, the communications company cofounded by Daire Hickey and Jennifer Ok. He did not comment on the proceedings. Web Summit has been contacted for comment. Web Summit was cofounded by Mr Cosgrave, Mr Hickey and David Kelly. Mr Cosgrave is currently involved in a number of legal actions with his co-founders.
