As our health system begins to return to normal activity levels following the Covid-19 pandemic, we would like to hear from doctors, nurses, paramedics, medical secretaries, hospital porters, canteen staff, and others, about one change they would like to see in our health system. It can be something simple that annoys you, day in, day out, that is easily fixed, or it can be a small change in practice or attitude that would make life easier for everyone. If you are interested in sharing your idea, you can email health@irishtimes.com (put “One Small Change” in the subject line), or fill in the online box here. If you are reading this in the app, click here. Thank you.
