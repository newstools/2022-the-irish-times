Sene Naoupu has been cleared to play in Ireland’s concluding TikTok Women’s Six Nations game against Scotland next Saturday at the Kingspan Stadium (kick-off 8pm, live on RTÉ 2) after the red card she received in last weekend’s defeat by England was downgraded to a yellow card by a disciplinary panel. The independent judicial committee consisting of Marcello d’Orey (Portugal), Juan Pablo Spirandelli (Argentina) and Sarah Smith (Scotland) heard the case, considering all the available evidence, including multiple broadcast angles and submissions from the player and her representatives. A Six Nations statement said: “The player accepted that she committed an act of foul play, but denied that the foul play was worthy of a red card. Having reviewed all the evidence, the committee deemed that: The player committed an act of foul play. There was a head contact. The act of foul play was due to a reckless act of the Irish player. The contact was indirect. The Ireland player was in a passive position. The act was worthy of a yellow card in consequence. “On that basis, the committee did not uphold the red card and the player is free to play again immediately.”
