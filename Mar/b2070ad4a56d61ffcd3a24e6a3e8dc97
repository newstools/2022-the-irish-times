The National Treasury Management Agency raised €750 million in an auction of treasury bills on Thursday, hitting its target once again. The short term debt will mature in five months. The sale was oversubscribed, with total bids of €1.5 billion received. The bills sold at a yield of -0.565 per cent. The State sold €1 billion in bonds on March 10th, with two bonds maturing in 10 and 15 years respectively. The NTMA is aiming to raise between €10 billion and €14 billion in the international bond markets this year, a significant reduction on the amount raised last year as the Government’s Covid-related spending eases.
