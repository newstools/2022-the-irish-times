The first battery-powered Dart train is expected to be in operation between Drogheda and Dublin within three years, Iarnród Éireann has said. The National Development Plan proposes expanding Dublin’s Dart network, boosting its reach from 50km to 150km. The €450 million infrastructure investment in the Dart+ Coastal North will, according to programme manager Paul Wilcock, allow for up to five trains an hour from Drogheda to Dublin in each of the three morning peak hours. There will be 37kms of new electrification and a more than doubling of passenger capacity from Drogheda to the city centre by increasing the number of trains from 11 to 24 and capacity for commuters from 12,500 to 26,600 over the peak period. The travel time from Drogheda to Connolly will be 50 minutes. As part of the programme, an additional platform will be built at McBride train station in Drogheda. The investment will have the potential to double the number of Darts between Howth and Howth Junction. Malahide will see a 50 per cent increase in passenger carrying capacity from approximately 23,000 to 33,800 passengers and an increase in service frequency from 20 to 30 trains to the city centre in the three hour morning peak period. A public consultation by Iarnród Éireann on the emerging preferred option for the project design was launched on Thursday. Iarnród Éireann will begin hosting public briefing webinars on March 8th. French firm Alstom will supply up to 750 carriages to Iarnród Éireann over 10 years for the extended Dart+ network.
