Dublin Airport has welcomed EygptAir’s launch of a direct route between the Irish capital and Cairo from June 2nd. The service, which will operate four times a week, will be Ireland’s first scheduled air service to and from Eygpt. The Cairo-headquartered Egyptian flag carrier, which operates to more than 75 destinations, has been in expansion mode of late. “We’re very pleased to welcome Egyptair to Ireland and to add Cairo to Dublin Airport’s extensive route network. Cairo is one of the world’s great cities and we will be working closely with Egyptair to promote this new route, which will be welcomed by both business and leisure travellers,” said Dublin Airport managing director Vincent Harrison. The route will be serviced by the A320 NEO aircraft, providing 16 seats in business class and 126 seats in economy class. “Due to Ireland’s significant location on the western part of the European continent, Dublin Airport represents a strategic hub for passengers flying to Egypt’s top leisure destinations, namely Sharm El-Sheikh, Hurghada, Luxor and Aswan,” said Egyptair Airlines chairman and chief executive Captain Amr Nabil.
