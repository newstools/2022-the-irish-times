Top UK trade kitchen supplier Howdens is to open six depots in the Republic, with the first opening its doors in Stillorgan Industrial Estate in Dublin on Thursday. Five other outlets will follow throughout the year and into early 2023, with locations planned for Ballyfermot, Ballymount, Glasnevin and Swords in Dublin this year and Bray, Co Wicklow opening early in 2023. The trade outlets, which will span about 10,000sq ft, will be supported by the infrastructure and digital platform already in place in the UK. Howdens supplies thousands of products directly to trade professionals, including kitchens, worktops, appliances, doors, joinery, flooring and hardware. “What makes our business model so successful is the powerful combination of locally empowered depot management, and a dedicated supply chain that can deliver our Irish customers an always in-stock offer,” said Mark Campbell, country manager, Howdens. Founded in 1995, Howdens has since grown to more than 780 depots in the UK. In April, it joined the FTSE 100. “We are incredibly proud to bring Howdens to the Irish market and continue with our trade-only model, with local stock availability at every depot,” said Andrew Livingston, chief executive of Howdens.
