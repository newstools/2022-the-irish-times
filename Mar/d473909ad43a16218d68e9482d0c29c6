Antrim 2-24 Offaly 2-17 A surge of second-half scoring propelled the Antrim hurlers to victory in Navan, securing their Division 1 status for 2023 and relegating Offaly in the process. Even without talisman forward Neil McManus the Saffrons had too much for Michael Fennelly’s Faithful who will return to the lower tier after just a season in Division 1. James McNaughton and Keelan Molloy scored the goals for Antrim though both arrived in the first-half and it was their point scoring ability in the second-half that ultimately decided this contest. The sides were level with 44 minutes on the clock but Antrim reeled off 0-13 from there on, to Offaly’s mere 1-3, to win with some to spare. McManus missed out with hamstring trouble while Michael Bradley and Niall McKenna were out too but Darren Gleeson’s side still delivered a high class performance. Free-taker Conal Cunning hit 0-10 while Antrim had nine different scorers in all as they retained their place in Division 1 for a third consecutive season. Offaly lost defender Joey Keenaghan to a 66th minute red card for two bookings while Antrim substitute Niall O’Connor’s 74th minute yellow card, on top of an earlier black, led to his exit. The sides will meet again in Round 1 of the Joe McDonagh Cup in mid-April and Antrim can fancy their chances. McNaughton’s fourth minute goal, after ghosting through the Offaly defence, and Molloy’s major in stoppage time left them 2-11 to 0-12 clear at half-time. Eoghan Cahill finished with 2-6 for Offaly and his first goal, from a 40th minute penalty, helped tie the game up at 1-14 to 2-11. Cahill grabbed a second goal at the death from a free but it was what Antrim did in the meantime that decided this contest, rattling off those 13 points from the likes of Cunning, Molloy, Joe Maskey and Eoin O’Neill to secure a hugely significant win.
