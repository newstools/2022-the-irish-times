Sir, – If the Tories are serious about sorting out the Northern Ireland protocol and completing Brexit, they must choose a new leader who is prepared to tell the EU that the UK will no longer apply any EU checks to goods coming in from Britain, but to be helpful will instead check the goods which may actually need checking, those destined for carriage across the land border into EU territory. Moreover, when physical checks are needed, they will be conducted at sites conveniently distributed across Northern Ireland and well away from the Border, in the same way that the Republic checks imports of solid fuel from Northern Ireland away from the Border, and the checks will be applied to locally produced goods on their way to the Border as well as goods brought in from outside. – Yours, etc, DR COOPER, Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK.
