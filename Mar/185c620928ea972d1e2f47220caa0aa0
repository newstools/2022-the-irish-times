Nottingham Forest 2 Huddersfield Town 1 Nottingham Forest will host Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals after coming from behind to beat Championship rivals Huddersfield 2-1 at the City Ground. Having had a Sam Surridge effort controversially ruled out for offside, Forest fell behind moments later when Tom Lees netted with a 13th-minute header. Surridge then struck an equaliser in the 29th minute, before Ryan Yates completed the turnaround for Steve Cooper’s men by nodding home eight minutes later. Forest, victorious against Arsenal and Leicester in the previous two rounds, advance to the last eight of the FA Cup for the first time in 26 years and a first meeting since 1999 with Liverpool, who will visit a week on Sunday. For Carlos Corberan’s Huddersfield, currently second in the Championship table, the result saw an 18-game unbeaten run in all competitions come to an end. Completed FA Cup quarter-final draw Saturday, March 19th Middlesbrough v Chelsea, 5.15 Sunday, March 20th Crystal Palace v Everton, 12.30 Southampton v Manchester City, 3.0 Nottingham Forest v Liverpool, 6.0
