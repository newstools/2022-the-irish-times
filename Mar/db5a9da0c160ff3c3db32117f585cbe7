Taoiseach Micheál Martin will attend the European council meeting in Brussels tomorrow. In a statement, his spokesman said: “The Taoiseach will attend an important meeting of the European Council in Brussels tomorrow which will discuss Russian military aggression against Ukraine, security and defence, energy, economic issues, Covid-19 and external relations. “He has now received two successive negative Covid tests ahead of his departure from the US, and he will fly home from Washington DC this evening.” It is understood that the Taoiseach’s camp consulted with Aer Lingus, Irish public health, Belgium and the EU, and was advised that they follow the same advice of waiting seven days from a positive test. Mr Martin is understood to be feeling well and is symptom free and will be wearing a mask while in Brussels. One of the issues to take centre stage is the cost of living. There have been calls from the Opposition and lobby groups for a cut in the VAT rate on fuel, a move the Government has resisted out of concern at losing a derogation for the current Irish rate from the EU. Asked if a VAT cut could happen, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “I think any further actions like reduction in VAT would have to be something that we do on a European level. “We’ve already reduced excise considerably and I think that has helped to mitigate the increase in the price of petrol, the price of diesel.” On whether he expects the issue to come up at this week’s European Council meeting he said there will certainly be discussion about further action that the European Union could take to reduce the cost of energy and fuel and electricity in particular. The summit of leaders of EU member states takes place in the buildings of the Council of the European Union in Brussels tomorrow and Friday.
