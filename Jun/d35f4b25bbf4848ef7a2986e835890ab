1 Put the butter into a pot over a low to medium heat. Let it melt and bubble. After three minutes or so it will start to foam, and the colour will change to a golden amber. 2 Immediately remove from the heat and add the sage leaves. Carefully swirl the sage around, then add the vinegar and set aside. 3 Cook the pasta as per instructions, but for the last two minutes add the leeks and cook until soft. 4 Drain, leaving a little water in the pan, then return the pasta to the pot with the sage butter. Season. 5 Serve straight away with the mortadella on the side and the cheese sprinkled generously over the top.
