The European Commission has approved a new €56 million support scheme for Irish farmers, in particular fodder producers, who have been affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The scheme, approved under the State Aid Temporary Crisis framework which allows for supports outside state aid rules when the EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance, will provide direct grants of up to €35,000 to producers directly hit by the crisis. The commission said the scheme was “necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a member state”.
