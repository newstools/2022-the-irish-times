A three-under-par round of 67 moved Shane Lowry into the top 10 at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach, Florida on Friday but the field will all be playing catch-up on America’s Daniel Berger after he opened up a three-shot lead at PGA National. Lowry, making his first appearance of the year on the PGA Tour this year, carded four birdies and a lone bogey in his round, the highlight being an exquisite approach shot from 160 yards on the 13th hole that set up an eight-foot birdie putt. Pádraig Harrington missed the cut by a shot as the veteran Dubliner’s first appearance of the year on the PGA Tour came to a disappointing early end as he missed the cut. Harrington’s opening round 73 had put him on the back foot in his bid to survive the midway cut and a second round 70 for three-over-par 143 – a round which featured one birdie and one bogey – wasn’t enough to ensure his survival. Berger – the man Harrington beat in a playoff for the title in 2015 – carded a second successive 65 for a 36-hole total of 130 to move to 10 under, three clear of Chris Kirk and Kurt Kitayama. “It’s nice to sit down in your own kitchen or your own bedroom and just feel like you’re at home and not be in a hotel,” said Berger of enjoying home comforts in his hometown tournament. “ We spend a lot of weeks on the road, so it’s nice to be at home . . . I’m just happy to be out playing golf and enjoying it and playing a place that I love. I’ve said it a million times, sleeping in my own bed is an amazing feeling.” Berger was happy he rose to the challenge the course posed him and told reporters: “I hit a lot of quality shots, even though they don’t look like they’re five feet from the hole, or 10 feet from the hole. I know that they’re so difficult, that to hit it to 20 feet is a good shot. “And that’s the challenge for this golf course is the pins are tucked, the greens are firm, wind’s up, so you have to be really on point with where you’re going to miss.” In the Jonsson Workwear Open in Durban, South Africa – a co-sanctioned event on the Challenge Tour and the Sunshine Tour – Northern Irish teenager Tom McKibbin finished with three straight birdies for a 68 for a midway total of 133 in tied-fifth place, nine strokes behind leader JC Ritchie who is chasing back-to-back wins after successfully defending the Cape Town Open last week.
