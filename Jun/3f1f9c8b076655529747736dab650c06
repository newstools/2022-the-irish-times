Ireland and Everton captain Séamus Coleman has been ruled out of Wednesday’s Nations League tie against Ukraine at the Aviva stadium. Coleman suffered a “groin, pubis issue” during the 1-0 defeat to Armenia in Yerevan on Saturday but Irish manager Stephen Kenny remains “hopeful” that the veteran defender will feature in the return leg against Ukraine in Lodz, Poland on June 14th. Gavin Bazunu, however, has left the camp following a “minor rib fracture”. Kenny is expected to retain Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher in the starting XI with Cyrus Christie favoured to replace Coleman at right wing back, although Chiedozie Ogbene remains an option, having played the position all season for Rotherham United.
