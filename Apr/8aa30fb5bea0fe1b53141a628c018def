Leona Maguire moved into the top 20 at the first women’s Major of the year, the Chevron Championship, as she carded a round of 69 on Friday. Maguire’s round at Rancho Mirage in California featured birdies at the 5th, 8th and 11th holes in a bogey-free card that brought her to three-under-par, six strokes behind the leader Hinako Shibuno. Shibuno, the 23-year-old Japanese golfer known as the “Smiling Cinderella” for how she gracefully makes her way around the course, shot a second round 66 to claim the lead at the midpoint of the Major. Already a Major winner, having captured the 2019 AIG Women’s Open, Shibuno – in her rookie season on the LPGA Tour – took a one-stroke lead over defending champion Patty Tavatanakit, Annie Park and Jennifer Kupcho. Stephanie Meadow made the cut on the number, after signing for a 72 to sit at one-over-par. In the Valero Texas Open in San Antonio on the PGA Tour, both Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell missed the cut. McIlroy followed his opening round of 72 with a lacklustre 73 on Friday, as he struggled to hit fairways. A sole birdie at the 17th hole was not enough to save the Northern Irishman after bogeys on the 2nd and 12th holes. McDowell suffered a tough week and missed the cut by six strokes on five-over-par. Hideki Matsuyama – due to defend his Masters title at Augusta National next week – was forced to retire with a neck/shoulder injury halfway through his second round. Matsuyama originally incurred the injury during last month’s Arnold Palmer Invitational and subsequently missed The Players. The Japanese player withdrew after nine holes of his second round, having covered the front nine in one-under 35 strokes.
